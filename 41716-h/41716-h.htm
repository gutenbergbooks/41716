<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book is an attempt to bring within focus the most
outstanding factors in the Pacific. With the exception
of Chapter II, which deals with the origin of the Polynesian
people, there is hardly an incident in the whole
book that has not come within the scope of my own personal
experience. Hence this is essentially a travel narrative.
I have confined myself to the task of interpreting
the problems of the Pacific in the light of the episodes of
everyday life. Wherever possible, I have tried to let
the incident speak for itself, and to include in the picture
the average ideals of the various races, together with
my own impressions of them and my own reflections.
The field is a tremendous one. It encompasses the most
important regions that lie along the great avenues of
commerce and general intercourse. The Pacific is a
great combination of geographical, ethnological, and political
factors that is extremely diverse in its sources.
I have tried to discern within them a unit of human
commonality, as the seeker after truth is bound to do if
his discoveries are to be of any value.</p>

<p>But the result has been an unconventional book. For
I have sometimes been compelled to make unity of time
and place subservient to that of subject matter. Hence
the reader may on occasion feel that the book returns
to the same field more than once. That has been unavoidable.
The problems that are found in Hawaii are essentially
the same as those in Samoa, though differing in
degree. It has therefore been necessary, after surveying
the whole field in one continuous narrative of my own
journey, to assemble stories, types, and descriptions
which illustrate certain problems, in separate chapters,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>regardless of their geographical settings. If the reader
bears this in mind he will not be surprised in Book Two
to find himself in Fiji, Samoa, Hawaii, or New Zealand
all at once&mdash;for issues are always more important than
boundaries.</p>

<p>The plan of the book has been to give the historical
approach to the Pacific and its native races; then to take
the reader upon a journey of over twenty thousand miles
around the Pacific. I hope that he will come away with a
clear impression of the immensity of the Ocean, of the
diversity of its natural and human elements, and the
splendor and picturesqueness of its make-up. Out
of this review certain problems emerge, the problems of
the relations of native and alien races, of marriages and
divorces, of markets and ideals&mdash;problems that affect the
primitive races in their own new place in the world. But
over and above and about these come the issues that
involve the more advanced races of Asia, Australasia,
and America&mdash;where they impinge upon each other and
where their interests in these minor races center. This
is the logic of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Though the importance of these problems is now obvious
to the world, I feel grateful to those who encouraged
me while I still felt myself almost like a voice
crying in the wilderness, on the subject. I therefore feel
specially indebted to the editors of <i>North American
Review</i>, <i>World's Work</i> and the <i>Outlook</i>, who first published
some of the material here incorporated. But so
rapid has been the movement of events that in no case
has it been possible for me to use more than the essence
of the ideas there published. In order to bring them up
to date, they have been completely re-written and made
an integral part of this book. Two or three of the descriptive
chapters have also appeared in <i>Century Magazine</i>
and <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, for permission to reprint
which I am indebted to them.</p>

<p>There is a further indebtedness which is much more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
difficult of acknowledgment. To my wife, Marjorie
Barstow, I am under obligation not only for her steadfast
encouragement, but for her judgment, understanding,
and untiring patience, without which my career of
authorship would have been trying indeed.</p>

<p class="center">
. . . &nbsp; stared at the Pacific&mdash;and all his men<br />
Looked at each other with a wild surmise&mdash;<br />
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.<br />
</p>

<p>Exactly four centuries after the event immortalized
by Keats, I outstripped Balboa's most fantastic
dreams by setting out upon the Pacific and traversing
the length and breadth of it. "It is a sight," we are
told, "in beholding which for the first time any man
would wish to be alone." I was. But whereas Balboa's
desires were accomplished in having obtained sight of
the Pacific, that achievement only whetted mine. He
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You see here, gentlemen and children mine, how our desires are
being accomplished, and the end of our labors. Of that we ought to
be certain, for, as it has turned out true what King Comogre's son told
of this sea to us, who never thought to see it, so I hold for certain
that what he told us of there being incomparable treasures in it will
be fulfilled. God and His blessed Mother who have assisted us, so
that we should arrive here and behold this sea, will favor us that we
may enjoy all that there is in it.</p></div>

<p class="noidt">The story of how far he was so assisted is part of the
tale of this book, for in all the wanderings which are
the substance of my accomplishment I can recall having
met with but a half-dozen of Balboa's kinsmen. Instead
there are streaming backward and forward across the
Pacific descendants of men Balboa hated and of others of
whom he knew nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Balboa was the first to see the ocean. He had left
his men behind just as they were about to reach the peak
from which he viewed it. But he was not the first to step
upon its shores. He sent some of his men down, and
of them one, Alonso Martin, was the first to have
that pleasure. Martin dipped his sword dramatically
into the brine and took possession of it all as far as his
mind's eye could reach. Yet to none of the men was this
vast hidden world more than a vision and a hope, and
the accidental name with which Magellan later christened
it seems, by virtue of the motives of gain which dominated
these adventurers, anything but descriptive. To be
pacific was not the way of the kings of Castile; nor, sad
to say, is it the way of most of their followers.</p>

<p>What was it that Balboa took possession of in the
name of his Castilian kings? Rather a courageous gamble,
to say the least. The dramatic and fictional possibilities
of such wholesale acquisition are illimitable. In
the mid-Pacific were a million or more savage cannibals;
in the far-Pacific, races with civilizations superior to his
own. At that very time China was extending the Great
Wall and keeping in repair the Grand Canal which had
been built before Balboa's kings were chiefs. Japan
was already a nation with arts and crafts, and a social
state sufficiently developed to be an aggressive influence
in the Oriental world, making inroads on Korea through
piracy. Korea was powerful enough to force Japan to
make amends. Four years after Balboa's discovery the
Portuguese arrived in Canton and opened China for the
first time to the European world. The Dutch were beginning
to think of Java. It was hardly Balboa's plan to
make of all these a little gift for his king: his act was but
the customary flourish of discoverers in those days. Men
who loved romance more than they loved reality were
ready to wander over the unknown seas and rake in their
discoveries for hire. Balboa, Magellan, Drake, roamed
the seas out of sheer love of wind and sail. Many a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
set forth in search of treasure never to be heard from
again; some only to have their passage guessed by virtue
of the signs of white blood in the faces of some of
the natives. For two hundred years haphazard discoveries
and national jealousies confused rather than enlightened
the European world. But late in the eighteenth
century, after a considerable lessening of interest in
exploration, Captain James Cook began that memorable
series of voyages which added more definite knowledge to
the geographical and racial make-up of the South Seas
than nearly all the other explorers put together. The
growth of the scientific spirit and the improvement in
navigation gave him the necessary impetus. Imbued
with scientific interest, he went to observe the transit of
Venus and to make close researches in the geography of
the Pacific. But to George Vancouver falls the praise
due to a constructive interest in the people whose lands
he uncovered. Wherever he went he left fruits and
domestic animals which contributed much to the happiness
of the primitives, and probably laid the foundation
for the future colonization of these scattered islands by
Europeans.</p>

<p>Backward and forward across the Pacific through four
centuries have moved the makers of this new Atlantis.
First from round Cape Horn, steering for the setting
sun, then from the Australian continent to the regions
of Alaska, these shuttles of the ages have woven their
fabric of the nations. Now the problem is, what is going
to be done with it?</p>

<p>I suppose I was really no worse than most people in
the matter of geography when I set forth on my venture.
Though the Pacific had lain at my feet for two
years, I seem to have had no definite notions of the "incomparable
treasures" that lay therein. Japan was
stored away in my mind as something to play with.
Typee, the cannibal Marquesas&mdash;ah! there was something
real and vigorous! Then the South Sea maidens!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Ideal labor conditions in New Zealand! Australia was
Botany Bay; the Philippines, the water cure. Confucius
was confusion to me, but Lao-tsze, the great sage of
China&mdash;in his philosophy I had found a meeting-ground
for East and West.</p>

<p>But I was sizzling with curiosity. I wanted to bring
within my own range of experience that "unplumbed,
salt estranging sea" with its area of seventy million
square miles, equivalent to "three Atlantics, seventy
Mediterraneans," and&mdash;aside from the hundreds of millions
of people round its shore&mdash;the seventy-odd millions
within its bosom. Yet of the myths, the beliefs,
the aspirations of these peoples, even the most knowing
gave contradictory accounts, and curiosity was perforce
my compass.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>Something in a voyage westward across the Pacific
gives one the sense of a great reunion; it is not a personal
experience, but an historic sensation. One may
have few incidents to relate, there may be only an occasional
squall. But in place of events is an abstraction
from world strife, a heading for the beginning of a cycle
of existence&mdash;for Asia, the birthplace of the human
race. The feeling is that of one making a tour of the
universe which has lasted ten thousand centuries and is
but at the moment nearing completion. For eons the
movement has been a westward one. Races have succumbed
to races in this westward reach for room. Pursuing
the retreating glaciers, mankind snatched up each
inch of land released, rushing wildly outward. After
the birth of man there was a split, in which some men
went westward and became Europeans, some eastward
and became Asiatics. The Amerindians were the kick of
that human explosion eastward which occurred some
time during the Wurm ice age.</p>

<p>One cannot grasp the significance of the Pacific who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
crosses it too swiftly. Every mapped-out route, every
guide-book must be laid aside, and schedules must cease
to count. With half a world of water to traverse, its
immensity becomes a reality only when one permits oneself
to be wayward, with every whim a goal.</p>

<p>A fellow-passenger said to me, "My boss has given
me two weeks' vacation."</p>

<p>"Mine has given me a lifetime," I answered.</p>

<p>In that mood I watched the <i>Lurline</i> push its way into
the San Francisco fogs and out through the fog-choked
Golden Gate. The fogs stayed with us a space beyond
and were gone, and the wide ocean lay in every direction
roundabout us.</p>

<p>I was bound for Japan by relays. Unable to secure
through passage to the Land of the Rising Sun, I did the
next best thing and booked for Honolulu. There I
planned to wait for some steamer with an unused berth
that would take me to Kyoto, Japan, in time to attend the
coronation of the Tenno, the crownless Emperor. After
all, Honolulu was not such an unfavorable spot in which
to prepare my soul for the august sight of emperor-worship
on a grand scale, I thought.</p>

<p>And at last I was out upon the bosom of the Pacific,
sailing without time limit or fixed plan, sailing where
did Cook and Drake and Vancouver, and knowing virtually
as little of what was about me as did they. Our
ship became the axis round which wheeled the universe,
and progress "a succession of days which is like one
day." We went on and on, and still the circle was
true. We moved, yet altered nothing. When the sky
was overcast, the ocean paled in sympathy; when it was
bright, the whitecapped, cool blue surface of the sea
abandoned itself to the light. At night the cleavage between
sea and sky was lost. Then we lost distance, altitude,
depth, and even speed. All became illusive&mdash;a time
for strong reason.</p>

<p>Then came a storm. The vast disk, the never-shifting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
circle shrank in the gathering mist. From the prow of
the ship, where I loved most to be, the world became
more lonely. The iron nose of the vessel burrowed into
the blue-green water, thrusting it back out of the way,
curling it over upon a volume of wind which struggled
noisily for release. The blue became deeper, the
strangled air assumed a thick gray color and emerged
in a fit of sputtering querulousness. But the ship lunged
on, as unperturbed as the Bhodistava before Mara, the
Evil One, sure that he was becoming Buddha.</p>

<p>We were dipping southward and soon tasted the full
flavor of the luscious tropical air. The ship never more
than swayed with the swells. During the days that followed
there was never more than the most elemental
squall. The nights were as clear and balmy as the days.
For seven days we danced and made merry to Hawaiian
melodies thrummed by an Hawaiian orchestra, or
screeched by an American talking-machine, or hammered
by a piano-player. The warm air began to play the devil
with our feelings.</p>

<p>Thus seven days passed. I had taken to sleeping out
on deck, under the open sky. The moon was brilliant,
the sea as smooth as a pond. I was awakened by whispered
conversation at five o'clock of that last day and
found a group of women huddling close on the forward
deck. Their hair was streaming down their backs, their
feet were bare, and their bodies wrapped in loose kimonos.
Some of the officers were pointing to the southwestern
horizon, where a barely perceptible streak of smoke
was rising over the rim of the sea. It was from Kilauea,
the volcano on the island of Hawaii, two hundred miles
away.</p>

<p>The air was fresh and balmy as on the day the earth
was born. Rolling cumulous clouds sought to postpone
the day by retarding the rising sun. Lighthouse lights
blinked their warnings. Molokai, the leper island,
emerged from the darkness. A blaze of sunlight broke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
through the clouds and day was in full swing. And as we
neared the island of Oahu, a full-masted wind-jammer,
every strip of sail spread to the breeze, came gliding
toward us from Honolulu.</p>

<p>By noon we were in the open harbor,&mdash;a fan-spread
of still water. The <i>Lurline</i> glided on and turned to the
right and we were before the little city of Honolulu.
I can still see the young captain on the bridge, pacing
from left to right, watching the water, issuing quiet directions
to the sailor who transmitted them, by indicator,
to the engine-room. We edged up to the piers amid a
profusion of greetings from shore and appeals for coins
from brown-skinned youngsters who could a moment
later be seen chasing them in the water far below the
surface.</p>

<p>This, then, is progress. In 1778, Captain Cook was
murdered by these islanders. To-day they "grovel" in
the seas for petty cash. One hundred and forty years!
Seven days!</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>But Hawaii was only my half-way house. I was still
reaching out for Japan. According to the advice of
steamship agencies I might have waited seven years
before any opportunity for getting there would come
my way. At twelve o'clock one day I learned that the
<i>Niagara</i> was in port. She was to sail for the Antipodes
at two. By two I was one of her passengers. Hadn't
"my boss" given me a lifetime's vacation?</p>

<p>The world before me was an unknown quantity, as it
doubtless is to at least all but one in a million of the
inhabitants of our globe. My ticket said Sydney, Australia.
How long would it take us? Two weeks? What
should we see en route? Two worlds? Here, in one single
journey I should cut a straight line across the routes
of Magellan, Drake, Cook, and into those of Tasman,&mdash;all
the great navigators of the last four hundred years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Here, then, I was to trace the steps of Melville, of Stevenson,
of Jack London,&mdash;largely with the personal recommendations
of Jack,&mdash;and of one then still unfamed,
Frederick O'Brien. All the courage in the face of the
unknown, all the conflicts between the world civilizations
in their various stages of development, all the dreams of
romance, of future welfare and achievement, would unfold
in my progress southward and fall into two much-talked-of
and little-understood divisions&mdash;East and
West. I was to discover for myself what it was that
Balboa and his like had taken possession of in their grandiloquent
fashion and were ready to defend against all
comers. Yet the flag at the mast was not Balboa's flag,
nor Tasman's, and the passengers among whom fate had
wheeled me were, with one exception, neither Spanish
nor Dutch, but British. As long as I moved from San
Francisco westward and as long as I remained in Honolulu,
I was, as far as customs and people were concerned,
in America. But from the moment I considered striking
off diagonally across the South Seas in the direction of
the Antarctic I was thrown among Britons. The clerk in
the steamship office was Canadian, the steamer was
British, the passengers were British, and the cool, casual
way in which the <i>Niagara</i> kicked herself off from the pier
and slipped out into the harbor was confirmation of a
certain cleavage. For there was none of the gaiety which
accompanies the arrival and departure of American
vessels,&mdash;no music, no serpentines, no cheering. We
just took to our screws and the open sea as though glad
to get away from an uncordial "week-end." This was a
British liner that was to cut across the equator, to climb
over the vast ridge of earth and dip down into the Antipodes.
We were to leave America far behind. Henceforward,
with but the single exception of tiny Pago Pago,
Samoa, we could not enter an American owned port,&mdash;and
on this route would miss even that one. And now that
mandates have become the vogue, there is in all that world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of water hardly an important spot that does not fly the
Union Jack. The sense of private ownership in all that
could be surveyed gave to the bearing of the passengers
an air of dignity which was not always latent in the individual.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ship pressed steadily on, coldly indifferent,
fearless and emotionless. We were nearing the
equator, and the days in its neighborhood steeped us all
in drooping feebleness. Climate gets us all, ultimately.
We forgot one another beneath the heavy weight of
nothingness which hangs over that equatorial world.
Sleep within my cabin was impossible, so I had the
steward bring me a mattress out on deck. At midnight
a heavy wind turned the air suddenly so cold that I had
to secure a blanket. The wind howling round the mast
and the flapping of the canvas sounded like a tragedy
without human agency. The night was pitch-black and
the blackness was intensified by intermittent streaks of
lightning. But there was no rain.</p>

<p>It was Tuesday, yet the next day was Thursday.
Where Wednesday went I have never been able to find
out. We had arrived at the point in the Pacific where
one day swallows up another and leaves none. The
European world, measuring the earth from its own
vantage-point, had allotted no day for the mid-Pacific,
so that instead of arriving at Suva, Fiji, in proper
sequence of time, we were both a day late and a day
ahead. We had cut across the 180th meridian, where
time is dovetailed.</p>

<p>That afternoon we sighted land for the first time in
seven days. Alofa Islands, pale blue, smooth-edged, were
a living lie to reality. A peculiar feeling came over me
in passing without touching terra firma. It was like the
longing for the sun after days and days of gray, the
longing for rain in the desert. It was the longing for the
return to the actualities of life after days on the unvariable
sea. And presently I was in Fiji, and the <i>Niagara</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
sailed on without me. Once again I changed my course
to wander among the South Seas and leave Sydney for
the future.</p>

<p>Yet even on land he who has been brought up on a continent
cannot escape a feeling of isolation, the consciousness
of being completely surrounded by water. After
you have had the deep beneath you for seven days, and
again seven days, you begin to feel that even the islands
are but floating in the same fluid. The fact that you cannot
go anywhere without riding the waves, and that it
takes two whole days by steamer to get from Fiji to
Samoa, and four from Fiji to New Zealand, and then four
again between New Zealand and Australia, a water-consciousness
takes possession of you, and the islands become
mere ledges upon which you rest occasionally.
Something of the joy of being a bird on the wing is the
experience of the traveler in the Pacific seas.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, my delight and surprise, early one
morning on my return trip from Samoa to Fiji, to find
the <i>Talune</i> sidling up to an unknown isle considerably
off our course. It was, we were told, the island of Niuafoou,
and was visited every month or so to deliver and
take off the mails. It was a chill morning. Everything
was blue with morning cold. The waves dashed in desperation
against the cliffs. Glad was I that we were not
run ashore, for I have never yet been able to see the
virtue in ice-cold sea-water. Fancy our consternation
when down slid a native, head first, from the bluff half
a mile away into the water, as we slide into a swimming-pool.
For a moment he was lost behind the tossing
crests. Then we saw him coming slowly toward us, resting
on a plank and paddling with his free hand, seeming
like a tremendous water-spider. Tied to a stick like to a
mast was a tightly wrapped bundle of mail. The <i>Talune</i>
kept swerving like an impatient horse, waiting for the
arrival of that amphibian. When he came alongside he
dropped the little bundle into a bucket let down to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
at the end of a rope, and kicked himself away. A second
man arrived with a packet,&mdash;the parcels-post man of
Niuafoou. A third came merely as an inspector. Meanwhile,
on the bluff the whole community had gathered
for the irregular lunar event.</p>

<p>Or, days later, after my second call at Fiji as the ship
pressed steadily on toward Auckland, New Zealand, we
passed the island of Mbenga where dwell the mystic fire-walkers
so vividly portrayed by Basil Thomson in his
"South Sea Yarns." I wished that I had had a "callous"
on my habits in cleanliness to protect me from the unpleasantnesses
of the vessel, as have those Fijian fire-walkers
on their soles, then I should have been happier.
Their soles are half an inch thick. I should have needed
a callous at least two inches thick to endure the <i>Talune</i>
more than the six days it took us to get from Samoa to
Auckland.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the fourth day of our journey
from Suva, Fiji, we passed the Great Barrier Island,
which stands fifty miles from Auckland. We crept down
the Hauraki Gulf, passed Little Barrier Island, and
entered Waitemata Harbor, where we dropped anchor,
awaiting the doctor's examination. Just from the tropics,
I was taken by surprise to find the wind biting and
chill as we went farther south, and here at the gates of
Auckland the coat I had unnecessarily carried on my arm
for months became most welcome. Before I could adjust
myself to the new landing-place, I had to readjust my
mind to another fact which had never been any vital
part of my psychology,&mdash;that henceforth the farther
south I should go the colder it would feel, and that though
it was the sixth of November, the longer I remained the
warmer it would become. In the presence of such phenomena,
losing a thirteenth day of one's month while
crossing the 180th meridian was a commonplace. The
habits of a short lifetime told me to put on my coat, for
winter was coming. But here I had come amongst queer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
New Zealanders who told me to unbutton it, even to shed
it, for spring, they assured me, was not far behind.</p>

<p>And then for the first time in months I felt the spirit
of the landlubber work its way into my consciousness
again. I had cut a diagonal line of 6,000 miles across a
mysterious, immeasurable sea, and my reason, my heart
and my body longed for respite from its benumbing influence.
I had seen enough to last me a long time. I
fairly ached for retirement inland, for sight of a cool,
still lake, for contact with snow-capped mountain peaks.
More than all else, I yearned for the cold, for the scent of
snow, for the snug satisfaction of self-generated warmth.
My soul and my body seemed seared and scorched by the
blazing tropical sun under the wide, unsheltered seas.
Later, when I should be "well" again, I thought, I would
risk the climb up over the equator, the curve of the world
that lies so close to the sun.</p>

<p>And now that I was settled I had time to reflect on all
I had seen. I had cut a diagonal line through the heart of
the Pacific, and had seen in succession the various types
of native races&mdash;the Hawaiians, the Fijians, the Samoans&mdash;while
all about me were the Maories. So I reviewed
and classified my memories before I started north on another
diagonal course which led me among the transplanted
white peoples of Australia and Asia. Yet one
question preceded all others: whence came these Pacific
peoples and when? The answer to that must be given
before specific descriptions of the South Sea Islanders
can be clear.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES</small></h3>

<p>Not even the speed of the fastest steamer afloat can
transport the white man from his sky-scraper and
subway civilization over the hump of the earth and down
into the South Seas without his undergoing a psychological
metamorphosis that is enchanting. He cannot
take his hard-and-fast materialistic illusions along with
him. Were he a passenger on the magic carpet itself,
and both time and space eliminated, the instant he found
himself among the tawny ones he would forget enough
of square streets and square buildings, square meals and
square deals, to become another person. Upon that cool
dewdrop of the universe, the Pacific, the giant steamer
chugs one rhythmically to rest and one dreams as only
one in a new life can dream, without being disturbed by
past or future.</p>

<p>One slumbers through this adolescent experience with
the smile and the conceit of youth. At last one arrives.
The enormous ship, upon whose deck have shuffled the
games of children too busy to play, slips away from the
pier and is swallowed up in the evening twilight. Left
thus detached from iron and certainty, one wonders what
would happen if there never should be iron and certainty
again in life. What if that ship should never return,
nor any other, and the months and years should lose
track of themselves, and memory become feeble as to
facts and fumble about in hyperbolic aspirations? What
if the actualities that knotted and gnarled one's emotions,
or flattened them out in precise conventions, should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
cease to affect one's daily doings? What if, for you,
never again were there to be factories and dimensions of
purse, or ambitions that ramble about in theories and
ethics, but only the need of filling one's being with food
and converting it into energy for the further procuring
of food, and the satisfaction of impulses that lead only
to the further vent of impulse,&mdash;and in that way a thousand
years went by? What would the white man be when
the lure of adventure and discovery suddenly revealed
him to a world phenomenally different from the one he
left behind in the bourn of his forgotten past?</p>

<p>As I let myself loose from such moorings as still held
me in touch with my world, the wonder grew by inversion.
When the <i>Niagara</i>, wingless dinosaur of the deep,
slid out into the lagoon beyond, I felt overcome with a
sense of drooping loneliness, like one going off into a
trance, like one for whom amazement is too intoxicating.</p>

<p>It had not been that way in Hawaii, for there already
the grip of the girder has made rigid the life of nature
and the people. But down beneath the line one could still
look over the corrugated iron roofs of sheds and forget.
Everywhere in the Fiji or the Samoan islands something
of antiquity cools one's senses with unheard questionings.
Instantly one wants to know how it happens that
these people came to be here, what accident or lure of
paleolithic life led them into this isolation. One cannot
get away from the feeling&mdash;however far inland one may
go&mdash;that the outer casings of this little lump of solid
earth beneath us is a fluent sea, a sea endless to unaided
longing. Homesickness never was like that, for ordinary
homesickness is too immediate, too personal. But this
longing for contact which comes over one in the mid-Pacific
islands is universal; it is a sudden consciousness
of eternity, and of the atom. One begins to conceive of
days and events and conditions as absolutely incompatible
with former experience. One's mind is set aglow
with inquiry, and over and over again, as one looks into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the face of some shy native or some spoiled flapper, one
wonders whence and how. And a slight fear: what if I,
too, were now unable ever to return, should I soon revert
to these customs, to the feeling of distance between men
and women, to the nakedness, not so much of body as of
mind?</p>

<p>That was what happened to Tahiti, to Maoriland, to
Hawaii, to the popping peaks of illusive worlds which to
ante-medieval isolated Europe could not exist because it
did not know of them. For thousands of years these
innumerable islands in the Pacific had been the habitation
of passionate men, of men who had come out in
their vessels from over <i>Kim's</i> way with decks that carried
a hundred or more persons; persons who doubtless
also entertained themselves with games because too busy
to play; persons with hopes and aspirations. A thousand
and more years ago the present inhabitants of Polynesia
may have dreamed of rearing a new India, a wider Caucasia,
just as the Pilgrims and the persecuted of Europe
dreamed, or the ambitious Englanders of New Zealand.
Welcomed here and ejected there, they passed on and
on and on, as far as Samoa and Tahiti. And slowly the
film of forgetfulness fixed their experiences. The big
ships and the giant canoes rotted in the harbors. They
had come to stay. The sun was burning their bridges
behind them. What need for means of going farther?
Eden had been found. And the soft, sweet flesh of young
maidens began, generation after generation, to be covered
with the tattooings of time, the records of the number
of times the race had been reborn. So, while the
nakedness of youth was being clothed, mind after mind
stored up unforgettable tales of exploit and of passion,
till fancy sang with triumph over things transitory, and
tawny men felt that never would they have to wander
more.</p>

<p>Is not this the history of every race on earth? Has
not every nation gloated over its antiquity and its secu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>rity?
Was not permanence a surety, and pride the father
of ease? And have not song and story been handed down
from generation to generation, or, with the more skilled
and the more proud races, been graved in stone or wax or
wood? And have not the more mighty and the more
venturesome come over the pass, or over the crest and
invaded and conquered and changed?</p>

<p>So it was when Polynesia awoke to see that which could
only be a god, because fashioned in the form of its own
imaginings, swept by its gorgeous sails into view,&mdash;the
ship of Captain Cook. Thus the racial memories that
had lain dormant in the Polynesians for centuries were
revived by Europeans. Narrative renders vividly their
surprise and wonder, especially on seeing the vessel girt
in iron such as had drifted in on fragments from the
unknown wrecks and had become to these natives more
precious than gold.</p>

<p>It seems to me that in the hearts and minds of heliolithic
man when he ventured eastward across the chain
of islands which links, or rather separates, Polynesia
and Melanesia from its home in Asia, he must have felt
just as Cook and Vancouver and Magellan felt. Bit by
bit I picked up those outer resemblances which give to
men the world over their basic brotherliness. They may
hate one another justly, but they cannot get away from
that fraternity. And they generally reveal relationship
when they least expect it.</p>

<p>Thus, as we kicked our way up the smooth waters of
the Rewa River, Fiji, in a launch laden with black faces
and proud shocks of curly hair, mixed with sleek people
of slightly lighter-hued India, a suggestion of the origin
of these people came to me. As these alien Indians, so
must have come these native negroids. I should have
felt successful in my method of inquiry, hopeful of feeling
my way into a solution of this wondering, had not an
outrigger canoe dragged itself across our course with a
dilapidated sail of bark-cloth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did they learn to sail?" I asked the white
skipper.</p>

<p>"They have always known it," he answered. "But
you seldom see these sails nowadays."</p>

<p>I wanted to take a snap-shot of it, but the lights of
evening, as those of tradition, were against me, and we
were clipping along too rapidly. The last example of an
art which brought the whole race eastward was being
carelessly retained.</p>

<p>A few days later I caught another glimpse of a past
that was working my sun-baked brain too much. We
were going up the river in a comfortable launch, some
missionaries and I, their unknown guest. We were about
twenty or thirty miles up the Rewa. With us was a
young native who spoke English rather well. I plied
him with questions, but his shyness and reticence, so
characteristic of isolated human beings, inhibited him.
At last he spoke, with an eye to my reactions, of the methods
of warfare along the palisades of the river.</p>

<p>"In my boyhood days," he said, "nobody knew anything
of his neighbor. People lived just a mile apart,
but you white people were not much stranger to us than
they were to one another. There was constant war. We
children were afraid to venture very far from our village."</p>

<p>"Has that always been the way?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, but I don't know," and that was all I
could get out of him. Yet it has not always been so, for
nothing is always so among people, and the Melanesian-Fijians
in many cases have welcomed and received among
them Samoans and Tongans, races distinctly different
from them. There is a definite separation, however, between
ourselves and the Fijians that is obvious even to
the casual tourist, and affords no easy solution of the
whence and why.</p>

<p>Not so among the Polynesians as in Samoa, where one
instantly feels at home. That which attracted me to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Fijian was his incompatibility, his unconscious aloofness,
his detachment.</p>

<p>There is, however, not much greater difference between
some of the races in the Pacific and the white men than
there is between any two of the European peoples themselves.
There is less difference between an Hawaiian
and a Maori, though they are separated by nearly four
thousand miles of unbroken sea, than there is between an
Englishman and a Frenchman with only a narrow channel
between them. In the Pacific, the chain of relationship
between races from New Zealand to Hawaii is somewhat
similar to that running north and south in Europe.
The variation becomes similarly more pronounced in the
latitudinal direction. In other words, the diversity existing
between European and Turk is something akin to
that between Samoan and Fijian,&mdash;from the point of
view of appearances.</p>

<p>Something of the kinship of peoples scattered over the
millions of square miles of Pacific seas becomes evident,
not so much in their own features and customs as in the
way in which they lend themselves to fusion with the
modern incoming nomads of the West. Something of the
possible migrations said to have taken place in that unromantic
age of man somewhere back in Pleistocene days
may be grasped from the streams that now flow in and
become part of the life of the South Pacific. Scientists
detect in the Melanesian-Fijian slight traces of Aryan
blood without being definite as to how it got there. When
I ran into a little fruit shop in Suva, just before sailing,
to taste for the last time the joys of mummy-apple, I
glimpsed for a second the how. For the proprietor was
a stout, gray-haired, dark-complexioned individual from
the island of St. Helena. In a vivid way he described to
me the tomb of Napoleon, spicing his account with a few
incidents of the emperor's life on the island. Should
no great flood of Europeans come to dilute the present
slight infusions, the centuries that lie in waiting will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
perhaps augment this accidental European strain into
some romantic story. In a thousand years it would not
at all be impossible for this story of Napoleon to become
part of Fijian legend, and for children to refer to that
unknown god of war as their god and the father of their
ideals. This genial islander from St. Helena will puzzle
anthropologists and afford them opportunities for conjecture,
fully as much as the evidence of Aryan and
Iberian races in Asia and the islands east of it does
to-day.</p>

<p>Or the wail of the Indian, into whose shop I strayed
to get out of the sun, at the downfall of "his" empire,
may be the little seed of thought out of which the aspirations
of a Fiji reborn will spring.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>According to the traditions of almost every race on
earth, the place of its nativity is the cradle of mankind.
Nor does mere accident satisfy. In nearly every instance
not only is the belief extant among natives that their race
was born there, but that, be the birthplace island or continent,
it came into existence by some form of special
creation as an abiding-place for a chosen people. The
Japanese <i>kami</i>, Izanagi and Izanami, were commissioned
by the other gods to "make, consolidate, and give birth
to the drifting land." "According to the Samoan cosmogony,
first there was Leai, nothing; thence sprung
Nanamu, fragrance; then Efuefu, dust; then Iloa, perceivable;
then Maua, obtainable; then Eleele, earth; then
Papatu, high rocks; then Maataanoa, small stones; then
Maunga, mountains. Then Maunga married Malaeliua,
or changeable meeting-place, and had a daughter called
Fasiefu, piece of dust." The more primitive Melanesians,
the Fijians, and the Australoids are less definite in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
their conceptions of whence they came, having in many
cases no traditions or myths to offer.</p>

<p>With all our scientific inquiry, we are to-day still lost
in the maze of probable origins of various races. The
birthplace of man is as much of a mystery as it ever was.
Ninety years ago, Darwin said of the South Pacific:
"Hence, both in space and time, we seem to be brought
somewhat near to that great fact&mdash;that mystery of
mysteries&mdash;the first appearance of new beings on this
earth." And in 1921 Roy Chapman Andrews set out
upon a third expedition to Mongolia in search of relics
and fossils of the oldest man. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With the exception of the Java specimen, all fossil human fragments
have been discovered in Europe or England. Nevertheless, the leading
scientists of the day believe that Asia was the early home of the human
race and that whatever light may be thrown upon the origin of man
will come from the great central Asian plateau north of the Himalaya
Mountains.</p></div>

<p>Thus his antiquity will doubtless interest man to his
dying day. Slogans epitomizing the spirit of races fan
the flames of human conflict. Conflict wears down the
differences between them, or shatters them and scatters
them to the whirling winds. Doubtless the records which
seem to us so lucid and so permanent will vanish from
the earth in the next half-million years, and our descendants
will mumble in terms of vague tradition expressions
of their beginning. Or perhaps their linguistics will
make ours vulgar and primitive by comparison. Possibly,
if our progress and development are not impeded,
the hundreds of tongues now spoken on this globe will
seem childishly incomplete, and in their stead will be
one extremely simple but flexible language spoken in
every islet in the seas.</p>

<p>What our present world will seem to the man of the
future, the world of the Pacific, wreathed in races of
every hue&mdash;Asia, Australasia, the Americas&mdash;seems to
us now. In the wide spaces of the Pacific we have several
thousands of islands, anchored at various distances from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
one another in about seventy million square miles of sea.
Grouped with a healthy regard for the freedom of individual
needs there are enough separate races, speaking
separate languages and abiding by separate customs, to
make the many-colored map of Europe seem one primary
hue by comparison. Yet all the romance which brightens
the pages of European history and its intake of Asiatic
culture is ordinary beside the mysterious silence that
steeps the origin and age of the cultures of the Pacific.
There, beneath the heavy curtain of unknown antiquity,
dwell innumerable people who, if they are not the Adams
and Eves of creation, have wandered very little from
the birthplace of the human race. It seems as though
the overflow of living creatures from the heart of Asia
had found an underground channel back into the Garden
of Eden, like some streamlet lost in the sands of the seashore,
but worming its way into the very depths below.
Polynesia, Micronesia, Melanesia, are the names by
which we know them. The drawer of water, as he lets
his bucket down to the farthest reaches of the wells of
antiquity, finds in his vessel evidence of kinship with
races now covering the whole of Europe. Romance has
it that the Amerindians are descendants of the Lost
Tribes of Israel and Mormon missionaries are carrying
that charm among the Polynesians. They are very successful
in New Zealand among the Maories. Like a great
current of warm water in the sea, the Polynesian races
have run from Hawaii to Samoa, the Marquesas, Tahiti,
and Maoriland. How they got there is still part of conjecture.</p>

<p>To most of us, the South Seas mean simply cannibals
and naked girls. Dark skins and giant bodies are synonymous
with Polynesians. The grouping of these peoples
into Poly-Mela-Micronesian has some scientific meaning
which, if not esoteric and awe-inspiring, slips by our
consciousness as altogether too highbrow to deserve consideration.
Or we are satisfied with pictures such as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Melville and O'Brien have given us, pictures that as long
as the world is young will thrill us as do those of Kinglake
and Marco Polo. But, those of us who have gone
beyond our boyhood rhymes of "Wild man from Borneo
just come to town" and have been White Shadows ourselves,
are keenly interested in the whence and the why
of these people. Can it be that Darwin was right? Have
we approached the spot whereon man made his first appearance
on the earth? Or are others right whose soundings
divulge a hidden course that gives these people a
birthplace ten thousand miles away, in central Asia? Is
it that all the people of the world were first made men
on land that is now beneath the waters of the Pacific,&mdash;men
who, because of geological changes, fell back across
Asia, leaving scattered remnants in the numerous island
peaks now standing alone in that sun-baked world?
"There is ground for the belief," says Griffith Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
"that the Pacific Ocean was smaller in the Pleistocene
period, being reduced by a belt of land varying in width
from 100 to 700 miles." Or are the further calculations
more accurate,&mdash;that there have been constant migrations
of people from Asia?</p>

<p>Slowly scientists are groping their way through legend.
No one who has been among the South Sea people,
and those of the western Pacific islands, can help being
impressed with certain remarkable likenesses between
them and European people. Present-day anthropologists
are at variance with the old evolutionary school
which believed in "a general, uniform evolution of culture
in which all parts of mankind participated." "At
present," according to Franz Boas, "at least among certain
groups of investigators in England and also in
Germany, ethnological research is based on the concept
of migration and dissemination rather than upon that of
evolution." In connection with Polynesia and the Pacific
peoples, it seems to be fairly well known that they drifted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
from island to island in giant canoes. They had no sails
nor compass, but, guided by stars and directed by the
will of the winds, they roved the high seas and landed
wherever the shores were hospitable. During ages when
Europe dreaded the sea and hugged the land, when the
European universe consisted of a flat table-like earth and
a dome-like heaven of stars,&mdash;even before the vikings
ventured on their wild marauding excursions, the Polynesians
made of the length and breadth of the Pacific a
highway for their canoes. "Somewhat before this
(450 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) one bold Polynesian had reached polar ice in
his huge war canoe."<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Our Amerindians dared the
swiftest rapids in their frail bark canoes; but what was
that compared with the courage and love of freedom
which sent this lone Polynesian out upon the endless
waters of the Pacific? Some day a poet will give him his
deserving place among the great heroes.</p>

<p>Dr. Macmillan Brown tells us that the Easter Islands
were once the center of a great Pacific empire. Here
men came from far and wide to pay tribute to one ruling
monarch. He builded himself a Venice amid the coral
reefs, with canals walled in by thirty feet of stone. Fear
of the control over the winds which this monarch was
said to possess, and superstitious dread of his ire brought
the vassal islanders to him with their choicest possessions,
though he had no military means of compelling
respect. This monarch, like the Pharaohs who
built the pyramids, must have had thousands of laborers
to have been able to cut, shape, and build the giant platforms
of stone or the great canals which are referred to
as the Venice of the Pacific. It must have taken no little
engineering skill so to adjust them to one another as to
require no mortar to keep them together. In the Caroline
Islands, now under Japanese mandate, there still
stand remains of stone buildings of a forgotten day's
requirements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>These relics of unknown days make it reasonably certain
that after having been "shot" out from the mainland,
the early people of the Pacific reached all the way
across to the island of Savaii, in the Samoan group, and
later as far as Tahiti. Why they did not go on to the
Americas is hard to say. Perhaps the virginity of the
islands and the congenial climate offered these artless
savages all they desired. Beyond were cold and drudgery.
Here, though labor and war were not wanting, still
there was balmy weather. Probably they were the tail-end
of the great migration of the Wurm ice age. More
venturesome than most, and having arrived at lands
roomy enough for their small numbers, they must have
called themselves blessed in that much good luck and
decided to take no further chances with the generosity
of the gods.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Linguistic and ethnological data link the Polynesians with the
Koreans, Japanese, Formosans, Indonesians, and Javanese. Legends
and genealogies show that about the dawn of our era the early Polynesians
were among the Malay Islands. By 450 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> they had reached
Samoa and by 850 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>, Tahiti.... In 1175 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> the primitive Maoriori
were driven out of New Zealand to the Chatham Isles. No doubt New
Zealand was first reached several hundred years before this. Tahiti
seems to have been a center of dispersal, as Percy Smith has pointed
out in his interesting book "Hawaiki." We must, however, remember
that Melanesians preceded the Polynesians to many of these islands
at a much earlier date.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></div>

<p>However, mutation is the law of life. Even these
small groups split into smaller factions. Some went south
to the islands of the Antipodes and called themselves
Maories; others went north of the equator and called
themselves Hawaiians. The physical distribution of all
the races in the Pacific, rooting, as we have seen, in
Asia, represents a virile plant the stem of which runs
eastward and is known as Micronesia and Melanesia,
with the flowers, in all their diversified loveliness,
Hawaii, Samoa, Tahiti, the Marquesas, and Maoriland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>What made them what they are? How is it that being,
as it seems, people of extraction similar to that of Europeans,
they have remained in such a state of arrested
development? How is it that they became cannibals,
eaters of men's flesh? Again the answer is not far to
seek. Just like the Europeans, they followed the line of
least resistance, having as yet developed no artificial or
brain-designed weapons against the stress of nature.
Europeans, in time of great famine, have not themselves
been above cannibalism. In our Southern States we have
isolated mountaineers to show us what men can revert to.
And in northern China to-day, essentially Buddhist and
non-flesh-eating, cannibalism was reported during the
famine last year.</p>

<p>But Europe had what Polynesia did not have. Driven
by the force of necessity out of continental Asia, Polynesia
hid itself away in the cracks and crannies of the
Pacific; Europeans spread over a small continent and
broke up into innumerable warring and learning tribes.
Backward and forward along peninsular Europe, men
communicated to one another their emotional and objective
experiences. The result has been a culture amazing
only in its diversity,&mdash;amazing because, with contact and
interchange of racial experiences, the coursing and recoursing
of the same blood, stirred and dissolved, it is
amazing that such diversity should persist.</p>

<p>But in Polynesia, Melanesia, Micronesia,&mdash;in all the
distant land-specks of the Pacific,&mdash;contact was impossible
in the larger sense. Though canoes did slide into
strange harbors or drift or row in and about the atolls,
they afforded at most romantic stimuli to these isolated
groups. Infusion of culture was very difficult. At most,
these causal meetings added to or confused the stories
of their origin. And in a little time the different island
groups forgot their beginnings.</p>

<p>Presently, the pressure upon their small areas with
the limited food supply began to make itself felt. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
method had to be devised for the limitation of population
and to keep in food what few numbers there were. There
seem to have been no indigenous animals anywhere in
the islands. Darwin found only a mouse, and of this he
was uncertain as to whether it really was indigenous.
Except for a few birds, and the giant Moa which roamed
the islands of New Zealand, animal life was everywhere
insufficient to the needs of so vital a people as were these.
But much less is heard to-day of the cannibalism said to
have run rampant among them. It is even disputed.
The fruits of the tropics, doubtless rich in vitamines, are
peculiarly suited to the sustenance of so spirited a race.</p>

<p>The Polynesians found in the various islands they approached,
during that slow, age-long migration eastward,
tribes and islanders inferior to themselves. So did the
Europeans in their movement westward. The primitive
Caucasians remained and mixed slightly along the way,
leaving here and there traces of their contact. And their
ancestors in Asia forgot their exiled offspring.</p>

<p>With the landing of Cook at Tahiti, at Poverty Bay,
at Hawaii, the counter invasion of the Pacific began. For
over a hundred years now the European has been injecting
his culture, his vices, his iron exactitude into the so-called
primitive races. These hundred years make the
second phase of civilization in the Pacific. It might have
been the last. It might have meant the reunion of Caucasic
peoples, their blending and their amalgamation,
and the world would have lived happily ever after. But
the eternal triangle plays its part in politics no less than
in love, and the third period, the period of rivalry and
jealousy, of suspicion and scandal, of still-born accomplishment
in many fields has set in. And tragedy, which
men love because it is closest to truth, is on the stage.</p>

<p>The third period dates largely from the discovery and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the awakening of Japan. It is the blocking of the European
invasion of the Pacific, and the institution of a
counter move,&mdash;that of the expansion of Asia into the
Pacific,&mdash;which will be treated in the last section of this
book.</p>

<p>To-day, Polynesia is barely holding its own. Its sons
have studied "abroad," they have been in our schools
and universities, they have fought in "our" war. Rapidly
they are putting aside the uncultured simplicity of
adolescence. For long they treasured drifts of iron-girded
flotsam which the waves in their impartiality cast
upon their shores; to-day iron is supplanting thatch,
and a belated iron age is reviving their imaginations,
just as iron guns and leaden bullets shattered them a
century ago. In the light of their astonishment, <i>Rip
Van Winkle</i> is a crude conception; Wells has had to
revise and enlarge "When the Sleeper Wakes" into
"The Outline of History." No man knows what is pregnant
in the Pacific; nor will the next nine eons reveal the
possibilities.</p>

<small>OUR FRONTIER IN THE PACIFIC</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>Honolulu marks our frontier in the Pacific.
Honolulu has been conquered. If the conquest is
that of love, then the offspring will be lovely; if of mere
force, or intrigue, then Heaven help Honolulu! As far
as outward signs go, we are in a city American in most
details. The numerous trolleys, the modern buildings,
the motor-cars, the undaunted Western efficiency which
no people is able to withstand has gripped Hawaii in an
iron grip. True that the foreign (that is, Hawaiian,
Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese) districts are steeped in
squalor, but this is old Honolulu. The new is a little
Los Angeles with all its soullessness, and it has taken
all the illusions of modern civilization to accomplish it.
The first illusion was that the natives would be better
off as Americans than as Hawaiians; the second, that
Hawaiians were lazy and Japanese and Chinese were
necessary; the third, that cleanliness is next to godliness.
How have these things worked out? The Hawaiians are
in the ever-receding minority, the Japanese in the unhappy
majority, and enjoyment of cleanliness has made
most men forget that it is only <i>next</i> to something else. If
the invited are coming to Honolulu expecting money-grabbers
to turn to poetry and petty politicians to philosophy,
they had better save their fares. If readers of
magazines expect to find a melting-pot in which all
the ingredients are dancing about with their arms round
one another's neck, they had better remain at home.</p>

<p>For the first and foremost effect of the tropics is to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
individualize things. In colder climes people huddle together
to conserve warmth; here they give one another
plenty of space. Virtually one of the first things the
new-comer does is to name and separate things from the
mass. Every little thing has its personality. Plants
grow in profusion, but each opens out to its utmost. One
is much more inclined to ask what this flower is called
in Honolulu than in America, for each stands out, and one
stands out to each. Honolulu exudes moisture and fragrance,
stirring the passions as does the scent of a clean
woman. It limbers up one's reasoning faculties and
arouses one's curiosity.</p>

<p>On the street every Chinese and every Japanese comes
in for his share of attention. One begins to single out
types as it has never occurred to one to do in New York.
In Honolulu all intermingle, flower in a sort of unity, but
in the very mass they retain their natural variations.
The white people are ordinarily good, they have mastered
the technique of life sufficiently and play tolerably
well to an uncritical audience. While the Hawaiian
policeman in charge of the traffic stands out in bold relief
because the dignity and importance of his position have
stiffened the easy tendencies of his race,&mdash;he is self-conscious.
Monarch of Confusion, arrayed in uniform,
tall and with the manner of one always looking from
beneath heavy eyebrows, it is said that he causes as much
trouble as he allays. But that is mere prejudice. Who
would dare ignore his arm and hand as he directs the
passing vehicle? He fascinates. He commands. His
austere silence is awe-inspiring. When he permits a
driver to pass, there is a touch of the contemptuous in
that relinquishment. Nor dare the driver turn the corner
till, in like manner, this human indicator points the direction
for him. The finger follows now almost mockingly,
until another car demands its attention, and it becomes
threatening again.</p>

<p>One hears of the all-inclusive South Seas as though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
it were something totally without variation. The average
tourist and scribe soon acquires the South-Sea style.
But the more discriminating know full well that the expressions
which describe one of the South Sea islands fall
flat when applied to another. "Liquid sunshine" is a
term peculiarly Hawaiian. It would never apply to Fiji,
for instance, for there the words "atmospheric secretion"
are more accurate. Hence, it is more than mere
political chance that has made Hawaii so utterly different
from the Philippines and the litter of South Seas.</p>

<p>Honolulu is essentially an American city. The hundreds
of motor-cars that dash in and about the streets
do so just as they would in "sunny California." The
shops that attract the Americans are just like any in
America,&mdash;clean, attractive, with their best foot forward.
So meticulous, so spotless, so untouchable are they that
the soul of the seeker nearly sickens for want of spice
and flavor. To have to live on Honolulu's Main Street
would be like drinking boiled water. One imagines that
when the white men came thither, finding disease and uncleanliness
rampant, they determined that if they were to
have nothing else they would have things clean. All newcomers
to Oriental and primitive countries cling to that
phase of civilization with something akin to terror. Generally
they get used to the dirt. They have not done so in
Honolulu. It may be that mere distance has something to
do with the different results, but certain it is that Manila,
under American control just as is Honolulu, has none of
these prim, not primitive, drawbacks. Twenty years of
American rule have done little really to Americanize
Manila, while they have utterly metamorphosed Honolulu.</p>

<p>The man-made machine has now outlived the vituperation
of idealists. The man-made machine is running,
and even the most romantic enjoys life the better for it.
Clean hotels, swimming-pools within-doors, motor-cars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
that bring nature to man with the least loss of time and
cost of fatigue,&mdash;these are things which only a fool would
despise. But one longs for some show of the human
touch, none the less, and cities that are built by machine
processes are, despite all their virtues, not attractive. At
least, they are not different enough from any other city
in the modern world to justify a week's journey for the
seeing. One hears that steamers and trains and airplanes
are killing romance. That is so, but not because
they in themselves conduce to satiety, but because they
destroy indigenous creations and substitute importations
and iron exactitude. Within the next few generations
there will, indeed, be a South Seas, indistinguishable and
without variety. Honolulu is an example. But Honolulu
is not Hawaii! It is only a bit of decoration. So we
shall leave this phase of Hawaii for consideration at a
time when, having seen the things native to the Pacific,
we reflect upon the meaning and purport of things alien.</p>

<p>In Hawaii, we are told,&mdash;and without exaggeration,&mdash;one
can stand in the full sunshine and watch the rain
across the street. So, too, can one enjoy some of the
material blessings of modern life, yet be within touch of
nature incomparably exquisite.</p>

<p>He was only a street-car conductor. Every day he
journeyed from the heart of Honolulu, like a little blood
corpuscle, through arteries of trade hardened by over-feeding,
in a jerking, rocking old trolley car, to the very
edge of Manoa Valley. His way lay along the fan-shaped
plane behind the sea, and was lined with semi-palatial
residences and Oahu College. Palms swayed
in the breeze, and the night-blooming cereus slept in the
glittering sunlight upon the stone walls. He was only
a street-car conductor, furnished with his three spare
meals a day and his bed, but he fed along the way on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
sweets that no street-car conductor in any other place in
the world has by way of compensation. He was carved
with wrinkles and his frail frame bent slightly forward,
but his heart was young within him, and he acted like
a plutocrat whose hobby was gardening and whose gardens
were rich with the finest flowers on earth. The
delight he took in the open country, barely the edge of
which he reached so many times a day, was pathetic.
When I asked him to let me off where I could wander on
the open road, he beamed with pleasure and delight, and
told me where I should have to go really to reach the
wild. There may be other places in the world as beautiful
and even more so, but no place ever had such a
street-car conductor to recommend it. And no recommendation
was ever more poetic and inspiring than this,&mdash;not
even that of the Promotion Committee of Honolulu.</p>

<p>And, strange to say, I have never been guided more
honestly and more truthfully than when that street-car
conductor advised me to go to Manoa Valley. I lived
an eternity of joy in the few hours I spent there. I knew
that not many miles beyond I should again be blocked
by the sea. I could not see it because of the hills which
spend three hundred and sixty-five days of every year
dressing themselves in their very best and posing before
the mirror of the sky. Not more than one or two natives
passed me, nor did any other living creature appear.
I could only romance with myself, refusing to be fooled
by the talk about fair maidens with leis round their necks.
I was certain that back home there were maidens whose
beauty could not be equaled here; whose soft, white skins
and shapely forms were never excelled by tropical loveliness.
But I was just as certain that there was nothing
at home that compared to nature as it is lavished upon
man here in Hawaii, and especially in Manoa Valley.</p>

<p>We all have our compensations, and I have even shown
preference for a return to the joys of genuine human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
beauty which the maker of worlds gave to America,
and to leave to the mid-Pacific verdure and altitudes
whose combination stirs my mind with passionate adoration
to this very day. Still, I shall ever be grateful to
that wizened street-car conductor for having suggested
that I visit his little valley, which he himself can enter
only after paying a penalty of sixteen journeys between
Heaven and Honolulu every day, carrying the money-makers
backward and forward. Perhaps he does not
regard it as a penalty. Perhaps he feels himself fully
compensated if one or two of his human parcels asks him
where may be found the Open Road.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>Sullen and less concerned with emotional or spiritual
values was the driver of the motor-bus whom we exhumed
one day from the heart of Honolulu's "foreign"
section. He evidently regarded nature on his route as too
great a strain on his brakes, though he, too, must have
felt that compensation was meted out to him manifold.
For few people come to Hawaii and leave without contributing
some small share to his support, as he is the
shuttle between Honolulu and Kaneohe, and carries the
thread of sheer joy through the eye of that wondrous
needle, the Pali.</p>

<p>At the Pali one senses the youth and vigor of our
earth. Its peak, piercing the sky, seems on the point
of emerging from the sea. It has raised its head above
the waters and stands with an air of contempt for loneliness,
wrapped in mist, defying the winds. The world
seems to fall away from it. It has triumphed. There is
none of that withdrawing dignity of Fujiyama, the great
man who looks on. The Pali imposes itself upon your
consciousness with spectacular gusto, like the villain
stamping his way into the very center of the stage and
gazing roundabout over a protruding chin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The palm-trees bow solemnly before changeless winds,
in the direction of Honolulu, which lies like an open fan
at the foot of the valley near the sea. Color is in action
everywhere,&mdash;spots of metallic green, of volcanic red,
filtered through a screen of marine gray. Honolulu lies
below to the rear; Kaneohe, beyond vast fields of pineapple,
before us; the sea, wide, open, limitless except
for the reaches of the heavens, binding all. And then
there is an upward, circular motion,&mdash;that of the rising
mists drawn by the burning rays of the sun pressing
landward and dashing themselves into the valley and
falling in sheets of rain upon the earth. Wedged into
a gully, as though caught and unable to break away, was
a heavy cloud,&mdash;but it was being drained of every drop
of moisture as a traveler held up by a gang of highway-men.</p>

<p>This circular motion is found not only in inanimate nature.
Once, at least, it has whirled the Hawaiians into
tragedy. Here, history tells us, Kamehameha I (the fifth
from the last of Hawaii's kings) hurled an army of native
Oahu islanders over this bluff, back into the source of
their being. Without quarter he pressed them on, over
this pass; while they, unwilling to yield to capture, chose
gladly to dash themselves into the valley below. One is
impressed by the striking interplay of emotion with sheer
nature. The controlling element which directs both man
and mountain seems the same. States and stars alike
emerge, crash, and crumble.</p>

<p>We rolled rapidly down into the valley past miles and
miles of pineapple fields. Then we came, as it were, to
the land's end. Nothing sheer now before us, nothing
precipitate. A bit of freshness, of coolness, and an imperceptible
tapering off. The sea.</p>

<p>Here at Kaneohe dwelt Arthur Mackaye, brother of
the poet, whose name was vaguely known to me. He was
slender, bearded, loosely clad, with open collar but not
without consciousness and conventionality,&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
conventionality in accordance with prescribed notions of freedom.
Refreshing, cool as the atmosphere roundabout,
distinct from the tropical lusciousness which is the general
state of both men and nature in and about Honolulu,
the personality of this lone man&mdash;this man who had flung
everything aside&mdash;was a fit complement to the experience
of Manoa Valley and the Pali.</p>

<p>He conducted a small sight-seeing expedition on his
own. The proprietor of a number of glass-bottomed
launches, he took me over the quiet waters of the reefs.
Throwing a black cloth over my head to shield me from
the brilliant sky, I gazed down into the still world within
the coral reefs. There lay unimaginable peace. What
the Pali affords in panorama, the bay at Kaneohe offers
in concentrated form. Pink-and-white forests twenty to
forty feet deep, with immense cavities and ledges of
delicate coral, fringe the shore. Fish of exquisite color
move in and out of these giant chambers, as much at
home in one as in another. Droll, sleepy sponges, like
lumps of porous mud, lie flat against the reefs, waiting
for something edible to come their way. Long green
sea-worms extend and contract like the tentacles of an
octopus in an insatiable search for food.</p>

<p>An unusual silence hangs over the memory of that
trip. I cannot recall that the unexpected companion I
picked up in Honolulu said anything; the lonely one who
furnished the glass-bottomed boat certainly said nothing;
the fish and sponges emphasized the tone of silence
associated with the experience. But the Pali shrieked;
it was the one imposing element that defied stillness.
And below it is Honolulu, where silence is not to be
found.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>For the Honolulu spirit is averse to silence. Honolulu
is the most talkative city in the world. The people seem
to talk with their eyes, with their gait, with their pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>tures.
Night and day there stirs the confusion of people
attending to one another's wants. One is in a ceaseless
whirl of extraverted emotions. One cannot get away
from it. The man who could be lonely in Honolulu would
have to have his ears closed with cement. If New York
were as talkative as Honolulu, not all of America's Main
Streets together would drown it out.</p>

<p>For Honolulu teems with good-fellowship. It is the
religion of Honolulu to have a good time, and every one
feels impelled before God and Patria to live up to its
precepts. Everybody not only has a good time but talks
having a good time. Not that there are no undercurrents
of jealousy and gossip. By no means. The stranger is
let into these with the same gusto that swirls him into
pleasurable activities. It is a busy, whirligig world.
Even the Y.M.C.A. spirit prevails without restraint. I
had found the building of the association very convenient,
and stopped there. That put the stamp of goodness
on me, but it did not exclude me from being drawn
into a roisterous crowd that danced and drank and dissipated
dollars, and heaved a sigh of relief that I did not
preach to it. Its members were glad that I was just
"stopping" at the Y. They didn't see how I could do
it, but that was my affair. If I still managed to be a good
fellow,&mdash;well, I belonged to Honolulu.</p>

<p>Charmian London had given me a note of introduction
to a friend, Wright, of the "Bulletin." Wright was a
bachelor and had a little bungalow across from the
Waikiki Hotel on the beach. There we met one evening.
It had every indication of the touch of a woman's hand.
It was neatly furnished, cozy, restful. Two nonchalant
young men came in, but after a delightful meal hurried
away to some party. Wright and I were left. What
should we do? Something must be done.</p>

<p>He ordered a touring-car. We whirled along under
the open sky with a most disporting moon, and it seemed
a pity we had none with us over whom to romanticize.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Quietly, as though we were on a moving stage, the world
slipped by,&mdash;palms, rice-fields ashimmer with silver
light. Through luxuriant avenues, we passed up the road
toward the Pali. Somewhere half-way we stopped. The
Country Club. A few introductions, a moment's stay,
and off we went again, this time to avoid the dance that
was to take place there. Slipping along under the moonlight,
we made our way back to Waikiki beach, dismissed
the car, and took a table at Heinie's which is now, I understand,
no more.</p>

<p>But we had only jumped from the frying-pan into the
fire. Others, bored with the club dance, had come to
Heinie's for more fling than dancing afforded. The hall
was not crowded, so we were soon noticed. Mr. Wright
was known.</p>

<p>"They want us to come over," he said. "Just excuse
me a moment."</p>

<p>Presently he returned. I had been specifically invited
over with him. I accepted the invitation. Then, till there
were no more minutes left of that day, we indulged in
one continuous passing of wits and wets. Before half
the evening was over, I was one of the crowd in genuine
Honolulu fashion, and nothing was too personal for expression.</p>

<p>But one there was in the group to whom all her indulgences
were obviously strange, though she seemed well
practised. She was a romantic soul, and sought to counteract
the teasing of the others. Her deprecation of
whisky and soda was almost like poor Satan's hatred of
hell. She vibrated to romantic memories like a cello G
string. When she learned that I was westward bound,
she fairly moaned with regret.</p>

<p>"China!&mdash;oh, dear, beloved China! I would give anything
in the world to get back there!" she exclaimed,
and whatever notions I had of the Orient became exalted
a thousandfold. But my own conviction is that she
missed the cheap servants which Honolulu lacks. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
other words, there were still not enough leisure and
Bubbling Well Roads in Honolulu, nor the international
atmosphere that is Shanghai's. But that is mere conjecture,
and she was a romantic soul, and good to look at.</p>

<p>But there were two others in the crowd who did not,
in their hilarious spirits, whirl into my ken until some
time afterward. Their speed was that of the comet's,
and what was a plodding little planet like myself to do
trying to move into their orbit? They were not native
daughters of Honolulu; most of their lives they had
spent in California, which in the light of Hawaii is a
raw, chill land. There they carried on the drab existence
of trying to earn a living,&mdash;just work and no play. But
evidently they had never given up hope. They were tall,
thin, fair, and jolly. They invested. They won. It was
only two thousand dollars. They earned as much every
year, no doubt, but it came to them in instalments. Now
they had a real roll. <i>Bang</i> went the job! American industry,
all that depended on their being stable, honest
producers, the smoothness of organization, was banished
from their minds. Let the country go to the dogs; they
were heading for Honolulu for a good time. And when
they got there they did not find the cupboard bare, nor
excommunication for being jobless.</p>

<p>For as long as two thousand dollars will last where
money flows freely (and there are plenty of men ready
to help stretch it with generous entertainment) these
two escaped toilers from the American deep ran the
gamut of Honolulu's conviviality. Night after night
they whispered amorous compliments in the ears of the
favorite dancers; day after day they flitted from party
to party. I had met them just as their two thousand
dollars were drawing to a close, but the only thing one
could hear was regret that they could not possibly be
extended. Honolulu was richer by two thousand; they
were poorer to the extent of perpetual restlessness and
rebellion against the necessity of holding down a job.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Yet the "Primer" published by the Promotion Committee
tells us that Hawaii is "not a paradise for the jobless."
These folk had no jobs, yet they certainly felt
and acted and spoke as though they were in Paradise.</p>

<p>Witness the arrivals and departures of steamers.
The crowds gather as for a f&ecirc;te or a carnival.
Bands play, serpentines stream over the ship's side, and
turn its dull color into a careless rainbow. Hawaiian
women sell leis, necklaces of the most luscious flowers
whose scent is enough to empassion the most passionless.
But as to jobs,&mdash;why, even the longshoremen seem to be
celebrating and the steamer moves as by spirit-power.</p>

<p>Visit Waikiki beach, and every day it is littered with
people who enjoy the afternoon hours on the tireless
breakers. Go to the hotels, and hardly an hour finds
them deserted. The motor-cars are constantly carrying
men and women about as though there was nothing in the
wide world to do. Even those who are unlucky enough
to have jobs attend to them in a leisurely sort of way.
Yet these jobless people hold up their hands in warning
to possible immigrants that there is no room for them,
that "Hawaii is not a paradise for the jobless."</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>Who, then, does the work of the island? It is obvious
that it is being done. There isn't another island in the
whole Pacific so modernized, so thoroughly equipped, so
American in every detail, so progressive and well-to-do.
It is the most sublimated of the sublime South Seas.
One wonders how white men could have remained so
energetic in the tropics, but one is not long left uninformed.
Honolulu is an example of a most ideal combination
of peoples, the inventive, progressive, constructive
white man with the energetic, persistent, plodding
Oriental. Without the one or the other, Honolulu would
not be what it is; both have contributed to the welfare of
the islands in ways immeasurable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, to find the Oriental elements
as much in evidence as the Occidental. One hardly
knows where one begins and the other ends. As spacious
and individualized as are the European sections, so the
Asiatic are a perfect jumble of details. The buildings
are drab, the streets are littered, the smells are insinuating,
the sounds excruciating.</p>

<p>A most painful noise upon an upper balcony of an
overhanging Chinese building made me come to with a
sudden clapping of my hands against my ears. As noise
goes, it was perfect,&mdash;without theme or harmony. It
could not have been more uncontrolled. What consolation
was it that in China there was more of it! Gratitude
awakened in me for the limitations a wise joss had placed
upon the capacities of the individual. Yet men are never
satisfied. These Chinese weren't, and combined their
energies. What one man couldn't accomplish, several
could at least approach. So we had a band. I should
certainly never have thought it possible, myself.</p>

<p>However, they were trying to achieve something. It
was neither gay nor mournful; nor was it sentimental.
What purpose could it possibly have served? Surely
they had no racial regrets or aspirations, they who
played it! The bird sings to his mate, but what mate
would listen to such tin-canning and howling, and not
die?</p>

<p>To me there was something charming in this shamelessness
of the Chinese, something childlike and na&iuml;ve.
I had never realized the meaning of that little rhyme,</p>

<p class="poem">
I would not give the weakest of my song<br />
For all the boasted strength of all the strong<br />
If but the million weak ones of the world<br />
Would realize their number and their wrong.<br />
</p>

<p>The thought is almost terrifying when applied to the
teeming hordes of the world, whether of Asia, Europe,
or the South Seas. If sheer numbers are any justification
of supremacy, God had better take His old world
back and reshape it nearer something rational. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
becomes conscious of this welling up of the world in
Hawaii. Not that the Chinese and the Japanese haven't
the same right to life and to its fulfilment in accordance
with latent instinct and ability, with all its special racial
traits and customs, but one doesn't just exactly see how
numbers have anything to do with it. Yet here are the
Chinese and Japanese slowly, quietly, persistently out-distancing
the white by a process of doubling in numbers,
where mentality and ingenuity would doubtless fail.</p>

<p>One hears much about the progress of the Orient.
That is, white folk talk much about the way in which the
East is taking to Western ways, and call that progress.
One would not expect that sort of progress to proceed
with any great velocity in the East itself, but it is only
necessary to observe the ingrowing tendencies of life in
Hawaii, however superficially, to see how foolishly optimistic
is the expectation of such progress. For even in
Hawaii, where everything has had to be built afresh,
where everybody is an alien&mdash;with very few exceptions&mdash;and
where the dominant element is European, the East
is still the East, and the West the West. There is a
slight overlapping, but not enough to make one lose
one's way,&mdash;to make a white man walk into a Chinese
restaurant and not know it. The fastidious white man
whose curiosity gets the better of him, moves about the
Chinese and Japanese districts fully conscious of his
own shortcomings. He is less able to feel at home there
than the Oriental on the main street; but why doesn't
the Oriental build for himself a main street?</p>

<p>I was abroad early one Sunday morning, headed for
the Chinese section. Lost in thought, I went along,
gazing on the ground. Had Charlie Chaplin's feet suddenly
come into my range of vision I should not have
been more surprised than I was when two tiny shoes,
hardly bigger than those of a large-sized doll, and with
some of that stiff, automatic movement of the <i>species
mechanicus</i>, dissipated my reflections. I raised my eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
slowly, as when waking, up, up, up,&mdash;hem of skirt, knees,
waist-line, flat bosom, narrow shoulders, sallow face, and
slit eyes! A Chinese woman! She was as big as a fourteen-year-old
girl, but her feet were a third of their due
proportion. How many thousands of years of natural
selection went into the making of those little feet? Yet
she was a rare enough exception to astound my abstracted
mind. About her strolled hundreds of others of
her race, who would have given much of life to possess
those two little feet.</p>

<p>Differences abound in Hawaii. The Chinese is no twin
brother of the Japanese. In fact, there is probably as
much relationship between the Hawaiian and the Japanese
as there is between these two "Oriental" races. The
major part of the Japanese being Malay and the Polynesian
Hawaiians having at least lived with the Malays
some hundreds of years ago and infused some of their
Caucasic ingredients into them, there is more of "home-coming"
when "Jap" meets "Poly," than when he meets
"Chink." But notwithstanding proximity and propinquity,
over which diplomatic letter-writers labor hard,
when the Chinese and the Japanese and the Hawaiian
come together, the Hawaiian "vanishes like dewdrops
by the roadside," the Chinese jogs along, and the Japanese
runs motor-cars and raises children. The Japanese
obtrudes himself much more upon the life of the community
than the other two races, but with no more relinquishment
of his own ways. He drives the cars and
he drives white men to more activity than they really enjoy.
And the Hawaiian sells necklaces of luscious flowers
under the shaded porticoes of the buildings along the
waterfront.</p>

<p>Aside from the adoption of our trousers and coat and
hat, and a few other unimportant aspects of our civilization,
the observer on the streets of Honolulu sees no
mingling of races. The only outward sign of this mixing
is the Salvation Army. There, large as life, with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
usual circular crowd about them, stood these soldiers of
misfortune, praising the Lord in English. A row of unlimited
Oriental offspring upon the curb; a few grown-ups
on the walk; a converted Japanese who looked as
though his Shinto father had disowned him; a self-conscious
white boy who confessed to having been converted
just recently; two indifferent-looking soldiers; a
distrustful-looking leader and a hopeless-visaged white
woman. Twenty feet away, a saloon. I wonder what the
Salvation Army is going to do now that that object of
attraction is no more.</p>

<p>As far as Honolulu was concerned, it seemed to me that
barter and trade were more intoxicating to the majority
than was drink. The world everywhere about seemed
a-litter with boxes and bales and shops and indulgences.
How much of all the things exchanged, how many of the
things for which these people toil endlessly, are worth
while or essential, or even truly satisfying? The dingy
stores, their only worth their damp coolness; the huddling
and the innocent dirt; the inextricable mesh of little
things to be done,&mdash;only the Chinese sage who posed for
my camera in front of his wee stock of yarns was able to
tell their value to life. His long, thin, pointed beard,
his lack of vanity in accepting my interest in him, his
genial smile and fatherly disinterestedness symbolized
more than anything I saw in Honolulu the virtue and endurance
of race. Beside the eager, grasping Japanese
and the rolling, expanding white men, he looked like the
overtowering palm-tree that seems to grow out of the
monkey-pod in the park.</p>


<h4>6</h4>

<p>To a creature from another world, hovering over us
in the unseen ether, watching us move about beneath the
sea of air which is life to us, Honolulu would seem like
a little glass aquarium. The human beings move about
as though on the best of terms with one another. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
look more gorgeous than others, but from outward appearances
they are as innocent of ill intentions against
one another as the aquatic creatures for which Hawaii is
famous, out in the cool, moist aquarium at Waikiki.</p>

<p>Kihikihi, the Hawaiians call one of them, and his
friends the white folk have christened him Moorish Idol.
I don't know what Kihikihi means, but as to his being
an idol, I can't accept that for a moment, except in so far
as he deserves to be idolized. For about him there is no
more of that static, woodeny thing which idols generally
are than there is about Pavlowa. Yet he is only a fish,
and not so very large at that. He is moon-shaped, but
rainbow-hued. He is perhaps three-quarters of an inch
across the shoulders, but six inches up and down, and
perhaps eight from nose to the ends of his two tails.
And so he looks like a three-quarter moon. Soft, vertical
bands of black, white, and egg-yellow run into one another
on both sides, and a long white plume trails downward
in a semicircle. He is the last word in form, translucent
harmony of color and of motion. He moves about
with rhythmic dignity and grace. At times his eyes
bulge with an eagerness and self-importance as though
the world depended on him for its security. Though he
is constantly searching for food, he does not seem avaricious;
and while he admits his importance, he is not
proud.</p>

<p>Kihikihi has a rival in Nainai, who has been given an
alias,&mdash;Surgeon Fish, light brown with an orange band
on his sides. Nainai is heavier than Kihikihi, more
plump. His color, too, is heavier and therefore seems
more restrained. It is richer and hence stimulates envy
and desire.</p>

<p>Lauwiliwili Unkunukuoeoe has no aliases, thank you,
but he has a snout on which his Hawaiian name could
be stamped in fourteen-point type and still leave room
for half a dozen aliases. Only a water-creature could
possess such a title as this and keep from dragging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
it in the mud. Knowing that he would be called by that
appellation in life, his Creator must have compensated
him with plenty of snout.</p>

<p>But it is better to have one long snout than eight. And
though no one would give preference to any devil-fish,
this long-snouted creature is the rival by an inverse ratio
of that eight-snouted glutton. The octopus, the devil of
the deep, is an insult to fishdom. The Moorish Idol and
this Medusa-like monster in the same aquarium make a
worse combination than Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. This
ugly, flabby, boneless body, just thick skin and muscle,
with a large bag for a head,&mdash;eight sea-worms extending
and contracting in an insatiable search for food is the
paramount example of gross materialism. If only the
high cost of living would drive to suicide this beast with
hundreds of mouths to feed, the world might be rid of a
perfidious-looking monster. But his looks do him great
injustice, and were the Hawaiian variety&mdash;which is, after
all, only squid&mdash;to disappear, the natives would be deprived
of one of their chief delicacies. At the markets&mdash;that
half-way house between aquaria and museums&mdash;numerous
dried octopus, like moth-eaten skins, lie about
waiting for the housewife's art to camouflage them. But
I shall have something to say elsewhere about markets
and museums, and now shall turn, for a moment, to more
startling wonders still.</p>

<p>An artist is delighted if he finds a study with a perfect
hand or a beautiful neck; or, in nature, if a simple charm
is left undisturbed by the confusion of human creation.
Yet at night as our ship passed the island of Maui, it
seemed to me that all the sweet simplicities that make
life worth while had been assembled here in the beginning
of the world and left untouched. The moon rose on
the peak of the cone-shaped mountain, and for a time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
stood set, like a moonstone in a ring. The pyramid of
night-blue earth was necklaced in street lights, which
stretched their frilled reflections across the surface of
the sea; and just back of it all lay the crater of Haleakala,
the House of the Sun.</p>

<p>At sunrise next morning we were docked at Hilo on
the island of Hawaii, two hundred miles from Honolulu.
There was nothing here impressive to me, despite the
waterfalls. For two and a half hours we drove by motor
over the turtle-back surface of Hawaii toward Kilauea.
Tree-ferns, palms, and plantations stretched in unending
recession far and wide. A sense of mystery and awe
crept slowly over me as we neared the region of the volcano.
At eleven we arrived at the Volcano House.</p>

<p>Yet, in a mood of strange indifference I gazed across
the five miles of flat, dark-brown frozen lava which is the
roof of the crater. Ash-colored fumes rose from the field
of fissures, like smoke from an underground village.
Sullen, sallow vapors, these. Sulphur banks, tree molds
cast in frozen lava, empty holes! Nothing within left to
rot, but fringed with forests and brush, sulphur-stained
or rooted in frozen lava. Everywhere promise of volcanic
fury, prophecy of the end of the world.</p>

<p>The road lay like a border round the rim of an antique
bowl which had been baked, cracked, chipped, but shaped
to a usefulness that is beauty. All day long we waited,
watching the clouds of gray fumes rise steadily, silently,
and with a sad disinterestedness out of the mouth of the
crater.</p>

<p>Frozen, the lava was the great bed of assurance, a
rock of fearlessness. It seemed to say to the volcano:
"I can be indifferent. Down there, deep down, is your
limitation. Rise out of the pit and you become, like me,
congealed. There, down in that deep, is your only hope
of life. This great field of lifeless lava is proof of your
effort to reach beyond your sphere. So why fear?" And
there was no fear.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">THE LAKE OF SPOUTING MOLTEN LAVA<br />

In the volcano of Kilauea. At night the white here shown is pink and terrifying</p>


<p>As night came on the gray fumes began to flush pink
with the reflection of the heart of the crater. We set out
in cars for the edge. Extinct craters yawned on every
side, their walls deep and upright. Some were overgrown
with green young trees, but as we came nearer
to the living crater, life ceased. Great rolls of cloud-fumes
rose from the gulch to wander away in silence.
What a strange journey to take! From out a boiling
pit where place is paid for by furious fighting, where
pressure is father of fountains of boiling rock, out from
struggle and howling fury, these gases rose into the
world of living matter, into the world of wind and water.
Out of the pit of destruction into the air, never ceasing,
always stirring down there, rising to where life to us is
death to it. The lava, seething, red, shoots aimlessly
upward, only to quell its own futile striving in intermittent
exhaustion.</p>

<p>We stood within a foot of the edge. Eight hundred
feet below us the lava roared and spit. In the night, the
entire volcano turned a pink glow, and before us lay
three-quarters of a mile of Inferno come true. The red
liquid heaves and hisses. Some of it shoots fully fifty
feet into the air; some is still-born and forms a pillar of
black stone in the midst of molten lava. From the other
corner a steady stream of lava issues into the main pool,
and the whole thumps and thuds and sputters and spouts,
restless, toiling eternally.</p>

<p>On our way to the crater we were talkative. We joked,
burnt paper over the cracks, discussed volcanic action,
and expressed opinions about death and the probability
of animal consciousness after death. But as we turned
away from the pit we fell silent. It was as though we had
looked into the unknown and had seen that which was not
meant for man to see. And the clouds of fumes continued
to issue calmly, unperturbed, with a dreadful persistence.</p>

<p>Just as our car groped its way through the mists to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the bend in the road, a Japanese stepped before us with
his hands outstretched. "Help!" he shouted. "Man
killed." We rushed to his assistance and found that a
party of Japanese in a Ford had run off the road and
dropped into a shallow crater. Down on the frozen bed
below huddled a group of men, women, and children,
terrified. As we crawled down we found one Japanese
sitting with the body of his dead companion in his arms,
pressing his hot face against the cold cheek of his comrade.
A chill drizzle swept down into the dark pit. It
was a scene to horrify a stoic. To the wretched group
our coming was a comfort the richness of which one could
no more describe than one could the torture of lava in
that pit over yonder.</p>

<p>Japanese are said to be fatalists. They hover about
Kilauea year in and year out. One man sat with a baby
in his arms, his feet dangling over the volcano. Playfully
he pretended to toss the child in, and it accepted all
as play. The same confidence the dead man had had in
the driver whose carelessness had overturned the car.
And now it seemed that his body belonged in the larger
pit at which he had marveled not more than half an hour
earlier.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I look back into the pit of memory where the molten
material, experience, has its ebb and flow, I can still see
the seething of rock within a cup of stone, the boiling
of nature within its own bosom. Where can one draw
the line between experience past and present? Wherever
I am, the shooting of that fountain of lava is as real as
it was to me then; nor can conglomerate noises drown
out the sound of lava pouring back into lava, of undermined
rock projections crashing with a hissing sound
back upon themselves. It is to me like the sound of
voices when King Kamehameha I forced the natives of
the island of Oahu over the Pali, and the group of terrified
Japanese were like the fish in the coral caves at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Kaneohe when aware of the approach of a fish that feeds
upon them.</p>

<p>Yet there is a sound rising clear in memory, perhaps
more wonderful even than the shrieking of tortured
human beings or the hissing of molten lava. As I stood
upon the rim of Halemaumau there arose the vision of
Kapiolani, the Hawaiian girl who, defying superstition,
ventured down into the jaws of the crater and by her
courage exorcised Kilauea of its devils. What in all
the world is more wonderful than frailty imbued with
passion mothering achievement? Kapiolani may be
called Hawaii's Joan of Arc. Unable to measure her
strength with men, she defied their gods. A world of
prejudice, all the world to her, stood between her and
Kilauea. Courage triumphant had conquered fear. In
defiance of her clan and of her own terror, she was the
first native to approach the crater, and in that she made
herself the equal of Kilauea. As she cast away the
Hawaiian idols, herself emerged an idol.</p>

<small>THE SUBLIMATED, SAVAGE FIJIANS</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>Fiji is to the Pacific what the eye is to the needle.
Swift as are the vessels which thread the largest
ocean on earth, travelers who do more than pass through
Fiji on their way between America and the Antipodes
are few. Yet the years have woven more than a mere
patchwork of romance round these islands. In climate
they are considered the most healthful of the South Sea
groups, though socially and from the point of view of
our civilization they do not occupy the same place in our
sentiments as do Samoa, Tahiti, the Marquesas, and the
Sandwich Islands. Largely, I suppose, because of the
ethnological accident that planted there a race of people
that is farther from Europeans than the Polynesians.
The Fijians are Melanesians, a negroid people said by
some to be a "sub-branch" of the Polynesians. They
have been slightly mixed through their contact with the
Tongans and the Samoans, but they are not definitely
related to either and full mixture is unlikely.</p>

<p>A century ago a number of Australian convicts escaped
to Fiji. They brought to these savage cannibal islanders
all the viciousness and arrogance of their type, and
imposed themselves upon the primitive natives. The
effect was not conducive of the best relations between
white people and natives, nor did it have an elevating influence
upon the latter. However, despite their cannibalism
and their unwillingness to yield to the influence
of our benign civilization, the Fijians are a people in
many ways superior to both the Polynesians east of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and the true Melanesians or Papuans to the west. They
are more moral; they are cleanly; their women occupy a
better position in relation to their men; and in character
and skill they are superior to their neighbors. I was
impressed with this dignity of the Fijians, conscious and
unconscious, from the time I first laid eyes on them. I
felt that, notwithstanding all that was said about them,
here was a people that stood aloof from mere imitation.</p>

<p>Yet such is the nature of reputation that when I announced
my intention of breaking my journey from Honolulu
to Australia at Fiji, my fellow-passengers were inclined
to commiserate with me. They wondered how one
with no special purposes&mdash;that is, without a job&mdash;could
risk cutting loose from his iron moorings in these savage
isles. Had they not read in their school geographies of
jungles and savages all mixed and wild, with mocking
natives grinning at you from behind bamboo-trees, living
expectations of a juicy dinner? They warned me about
dengue fever; they extolled the virtues of the Fijian
maidens, and exaggerated the vices of the Fijian men.
The word "cannibals" howled round my head as the impersonal
wind had howled round the masts of the steamer
one night. But the adventurer soon learns that there is
none so unknowing as the average globe-trotters (the
people who have been there); so he listens politely and
goes his own way.</p>

<p>When, therefore, I got the first real whiff of tropical
sweetness, mixed though it was with copra and mold, all
other considerations vanished. From the cool heights
the hills looked down in pity upon the little village of
Suva as it lay prostrate beneath the sun. If there was
any movement to be seen, it was upon the lapping waters
of the harbor, where numerous boats swarmed with black-bodied,
glossy-skinned natives in that universal pursuit
of life and happiness. As the <i>Niagara</i> sidled up to the
pier and made fast her hawsers, these black fellows
rushed upon her decks and into the holds like so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
ants, and what had till then been inanimate became as
though possessed.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>I had been under the impression that the natives were
all lazy, but the manner of their handling of cargo soon
dissipated that notion. Further to discredit the rumor-mongers,
three Fijians staged an attempt to lead a donkey
ashore which would have shamed the most enthusiastic
believer in the practice of counting ten before getting
angry and trying three times before giving up. The
Fijian is as indifferent to big as to little tasks, and seems
to be alone, of all the dwellers in the tropics, in this
apathetic attitude toward life. There is none in all the
world more lazy, indolent, and do-nothing than the white
man. As soon as he comes within sight of a native anywhere,
that native does his labor for him; you may count
on it.</p>

<p>So it was that with fear and trembling I announced to
the stewards that I had a steamer trunk which I wanted
ashore with me. They grunted and growled as the two
of them struggled with it along the gang-plank and
dropped it as Atlas might have been expected to drop
the earth, and stood there with a contemptuous look of
expectation. I took out two half-dollars and handed one
to each. The sneer that formed under their noses was
well practised, I could see, and they took great pains to
inform me that they were no niggers, they would not
take the trunk another foot. There it was. I was lost,
scorned, and humiliated. Why did I have so much worldly
goods to worry about? Just then a portly Fijian
stepped up. Beside him I felt puny, doubly humble now.
Before I had time to decide whether or not he was going
to pick me up by the nape of the neck and carry me off to
a feast, he took my trunk instead. Though it weighed
fully a hundred and sixty-five pounds, it rose to his shoulders&mdash;up
there a foot and a half above me&mdash;and the giant
strode along the pier with as little concern as though it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
were empty. The two stewards stood looking on with
an air of superiority typical of the white men among
colored.</p>

<p>I cannot say that mere brawn ever entitles any man to
rank, and that the white generally substitutes brain for
brawn is obvious. But I failed to see wherein they justified
their conceit, for to men of their type the fist is
still the symbol of their ideal, as it is to the majority
of white men. And as I came away from the ship again
that afternoon I found a young steward, a mere lad,
standing in a corner crying, his cheek swollen and red.
I asked him what happened. "The steward hit me,"
he said, trying to restrain himself from crying. "I
thought I was through and went for my supper so as
to get ashore a bit. He came up and asked me what I
was doing. I told him, and he struck me with his fist."
Yet the stewards thought themselves too good to do any
labor with black men about. No ship in a tropical port
is manned by the sailors; there they take a vacation, as
it were.</p>

<p>From the customs shed to my hotel the selfsame Fijian
carried my trunk majestically. I felt hopeful that for
a time at least I should see the last of stewards and their
ilk. But before I was two days in Suva I learned that
shore stewards are often not any better, and was happy
to get farther inland away from the port for the short
time I could afford to spend in the tropics.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some of the younger of my fellow-passengers
came on shore and began doing the rounds, into
which they inveigled me. From one store to the other
we went, examining the moldy, withered, incomplete
stocks of the traders. Magazines stained brown with
age, cheap paper-covered novels, native strings of beads
formed part of the stock in trade. We soon exhausted
Suva.</p>

<p>At the corner of the right angle made by Victoria
Parade and the pier stood a Victoria coach. A horse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
slept on three legs, in front of it, and a Hindu sat upon
the seat like a hump on an elongated camel. We roused
them from their dozing and began to bargain for their
hire. Six of us climbed into the coach and slowly, as
though it were fastened to the ground, the horse began to
move, followed by the driver, the carriage, and the six
of us. For an hour we continued in the direction in
which the three had been standing, along the beach, up a
little knoll, past corrugated-iron-roofed shacks, and down
into Suva again; the horse stopped with the carriage behind
him in exactly the same position in which we had
found them, and driver and beast went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Much is heard these days about the effects of the railroad
and the steamer and the wireless telegraph on the
unity of the world, but to those travelers and that Hindu
and to the Fijians whom we passed en route, not even the
insertion of our six shillings in the driver's pocket has,
I am sure, as much as left the faintest impression on any
of us except myself. And on me it has left the impression
of the utter inconsequence of most traveling.</p>

<p>Thus Suva, the eye of Fiji and of the needle of the
Pacific, is threaded, but there is nothing to sew. The
unexpected never happens. There are no poets or philosophers,
no theaters or cabarets in Suva, as far as mere
eye can see,&mdash;nothing but smell of mold and copra (cocoanut
oil).</p>

<p>In Suva one cannot long remain alert. The sun
is stupefying. The person just arrived finds himself
stifled by the sharp smells all about him as though the
air were poisoned with too much life. The shaggy green
hills, rugged and wild in the extreme, show even at a
distance the struggle between life and death which moment
by moment takes place. Luxuriant as on the morning
of creation, the vegetation seems to be rotting as after
a period of death. In Suva everything smells damp and
moldy. You cannot get away from it. The stores you
buy in, the bed you sleep in, the room you eat in,&mdash;all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
have the same odor. The books in the little library are
eaten full of holes through which the flat bookworms
wander as by right of eminent domain. Offensive to the
uninitiated is the smell of copra. The swarms of Fijians
who attack the cargo smell of it and glisten with it.
The boats smell of it and the air is heavy with it. If
copra and mold could be banished from the islands, the
impression of loveliness which is the essence of the South
Seas would remain untainted. Yet to-day, let me but
get a whiff of cocoanut-oil from a drug store and I am
immediately transported to the South Seas and my being
goes a-wandering.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>I seldom dream, but at the moment of waking in
strange surroundings after an unusual run of events my
mind rehearses as in a dream the experiences gained during
consciousness. When the knuckles of the Fijian&mdash;and
he has knuckles&mdash;sounded on my door at seven to announce
my morning tea, I woke with a sense of heaviness,
as though submerged in a world from which I could
never again escape. At seven-fifteen another Fijian
came for my laundry; at seven-thirty a third came for
my shoes. Seeing that it was useless to remain in bed
longer, I got up. I was not many minutes on the street
before I realized the urgency in those several early visits.
Daylight-saving is an absolute necessity in the tropics,
for by eight or nine one has to endure our noonday sun,
and unless something is accomplished before that time
one must perforce wait till late afternoon for another
opportunity. To keep an ordinary coat on an ordinary
back in Suva is like trying to live in a fireless cooker
while angry. Even in the shade one is grateful for white
duck instead of woolens, so before long I had acquired
an Irish poplin coat. Yet Fiji is one of the most healthful
of the South Sea islands.</p>

<p>Owing to the heat, most likely&mdash;to give the white devils<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
their due&mdash;procrastination is the order of life. "Everything
here is 'malua,'" explained the manager of "The
Fiji Times" to me. "No matter what you want or whom
you ask for it, 'wait a bit' will be the process." And
he forthwith demonstrated, quite unconsciously, that he
knew whereof he spoke. I wanted to get some information
about the interior which he might just as easily have
given me off-hand, but he asked me to wait a bit. I
did. He left his office, walked all the way up the street
with me to show me a photographer's place where I
should be able to get what I was after, and stood about
with me waiting for the photographer to make up his
mind whether he had the time to see me or not. There's
no use rushing anybody. The authorities have been several
years trying to get one of the off streets of Suva
paved. It has been "worked on," but the task, turned to
every now and then for half an hour, requires numerous
rest periods.</p>

<p>In Fiji, every one moves adagio. The white man looks
on and commands; the Indian coolie slinks about and
slaves; the Fijian works on occasion but generally passes
tasks by with sporty indifference. Yet there is no absence
of life. Beginning with the noise and confusion
at the pier, there is a steady stream of individuals on
whom shadows are lost, though they have nothing on
them but their skins and their sulus. The Fijian idles,
allows the Indian to work, happy to be left alone, happy
if he can add a shilling to his possessions,&mdash;an old vest,
a torn pair of trousers of any shape, an old coat, or a
stiff-bosomed shirt sans coat or vest or trousers. Tall,
mighty, and picturesque, his coiffure the pride of his life,
he watches with a confidence well suited to his origin and
his race the changes going on about him.</p>

<p>Thus, while his island's fruits are being crated and
carted off by the ship-load for foreign consumption, he
helps in the process for the mere privilege of subsidized
loafing. All the fun he gets out of trade in the tropics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
seems to be the opportunity of swearing at his fellows
in fiji-ized versions of curses taught him by the white
man. Or he stands erect on the flat punt as it comes in
from regions unknown, bearing bananas green from the
tree, the very picture of ease and contentment. Yet one
little tug with foreign impertinence tows half a dozen
punts, depriving him even of this element of romance
in his life.</p>

<p>Still, there is nothing sullen in his make-up. A dozen
mummy-apples&mdash;better than bread to him&mdash;tied together
with a string, suffice to make his primitive heart glad.
Primitive these people are; their instincts, never led
astray very far by such frills and trappings as keep us
jogging along are none the less human. Unfold your
camera and suggest taking a picture of any one of
them and forthwith he straightens up, transforms his
features, and adjusts his loin-cloth; nor will he forget
to brush his hair with his hand. What a strange thing
is this instinct in human nature anywhere in the world
which substitutes so much starch for a slouch the moment
one sees a one-eyed box pointing in his direction! None
ever hoped to see a print of himself, but all posed as
though the click of that little shutter were the recipe for
perpetual youth.</p>

<p>The motive is not always one of vanity. Generally,
at the sound of the shutter, a hand shoots out in anticipation
of reward. In the tropics it is no little task to
bring oneself together so suddenly, and the effort should
be fully compensated. The expenditure of energy involved
in posing is worthy of remuneration. Nevertheless,
vanity is inherent in this response. The Fijian is
a handsome creature, and he knows it. He knows how to
make his hair the envy of the world. "Permanent-wave"
establishments would go out of business here in America
if some skilled Fijian could endure our climate. He
would give such permanence to blondes and brunettes
as would cost only twenty-five cents and would really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
last. He would not plaster the hair down and cover it
with a net against the least ruffle of the wind. When he
got through with it it would stand straight up in the
air, four to six inches long, and would serve as an insulator
against the burning rays of the sun unrivaled anywhere
in the world. While I squinted and slunk in the
shade, the native chose the open highway. Give him a
cluster of breadfruit to carry and a bank messenger
with a bag of bullion could not seem more important.</p>

<p>The Fijians, notwithstanding the fact that they take
less to the sentimental in our civilization than the Samoans,
are a fine race. Their softness of nature is a surprising
inversion of their former ferocity. What one
sees of them in Suva helps to fortify one in this conclusion;
a visit farther inland leaves not a shadow of doubt.
And pretty as the harbor is, it is as nothing compared
with the loveliness of river and hills in the interior.</p>

<p>I was making my way to the pier in search of the launch
that would take me up the Rewa River, when a giant
Fijian approached me. He spoke English as few foreign
to the tongue can speak it. A coat, a watch, and a cane&mdash;a
lordly biped&mdash;he did not hesitate to refer to his virtues
proudly. He answered my unspoken question as
to his inches by assuring me he was six feet three in
his stocking feet (he wore no stockings) and was forty-five
years old. For a few minutes we chatted amicably
about Fiji and its places of interest. There was never
a smug reference to anything even suggestive of the lascivious&mdash;as
would have been the case with a guide in
Japan, or Europe&mdash;yet he cordially offered to conduct
and protect me through Fijiland. Had I had a billion
dollars in gold upon me I felt that I might have put
myself in his care anywhere in the world. But I was
already engaged to go up the Rewa River and could not
hire him. Cordially and generously, as an old friend
might have done, he told me what to look for and bid
me have a good time.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<h4>4</h4>

<p>I took the launch which makes daily trips up the Rewa.
The little vessel was black with natives&mdash;outside, inside,
everywhere, streaming over to the pier. It was owned
and operated by an Englishman named Message. Even
in the traffic on this river combination threatens individual
enterprise. "The company has several launches.
It runs them on schedule time, stopping only at special
stations, regardless of the convenience to the Fijians.
It is trying to force me out of business," said Mr. Message,
a look of troubled defiance in his face. "But I am
just as determined to beat it."</p>

<p>So he operates his launch to suit the natives, winning
their good-will and patronage. It was interesting to see
how his method worked. No better lesson in the instinctive
tendency toward co&ouml;peration and mutual aid could
be found. He had no white assistant, but every Fijian
who could find room on the launch constituted himself a
longshoreman. They enjoyed playing with the launch.
They helped in the work of loading and unloading one
another's petty cargo, such as kerosene, corrugated iron
for roofing (which is everywhere replacing thatch), and
odd sticks of wood. And the jollity that electrified them
was a delightful commentary on this one white man's
humanity.</p>

<p>Delight rides at a spirited pace on this river Rewa.
The banks are seldom more than a couple of feet above
the water. The launch makes straight for the shore
wherever a Fijian recognizes his hut, and he scrambles
off as best he can. Here and there round the bends natives
in <i>takias</i> (somewhat like outrigger canoes with mat
sails, now seldom used), punts, or rowboats slip by in
the twilight.</p>

<p>The sun had set by the time all the little stops had been
made between Suva and Davuilevu, the last stopping-place.
Each man, as he stepped from this little float<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of modernism, clambered up the bank and disappeared
amid the sugar-cane. What a world of romance and
change he took into the dark-brown hut he calls his own!
What news of the world must he not have brought back
with him! A commuter, he had probably gone in by
that morning's launch, in which case he spent three full
hours in "toil" or in the purchase of a sheet of corrugated
iron or a tin of oil. He may have helped himself
to a shirt from somebody's clothes-line in the spare time
left him. One thing was certain, there were no chocolates
in his pockets, for he had no pockets, and I saw no
young woman holding a baby in her arms for daddy to
greet.</p>

<p>Yet even from a distance one recognized something of
family affection. To enter and examine closely would
perhaps have made a difference in my impressions. I
was content with these hazy pictures, to see these dark-skinned
people merge with their brown-thatched huts curtained
by shadows within the cane-fields. When night
came on all was dissolved in shadow, and voices in song
rose on the cool air.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>The Rewa River runs between two antagonistic institutions.
At Davuilevu (the Great Conch-Shell) there is
a mission station on one side and a sugar-mill on the
other. Both are deeply affecting the character and environment
of the Fijians, yet the contrast in the results
is too obvious to be overlooked by even the most casual
observer.</p>

<p>As I stepped off the boat a young New Zealander
whose cousin had come down with us on the <i>Niagara</i>
and whom I had met the day of our arrival in Suva,
came out of a building across the road. He was conducting
a class in carpentry composed of young Fijian
students of the mission. They were so absorbed in their
work that they barely noticed me, and the atmosphere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of sober earnestness about the place was thrilling. From
time out of mind the Fijians have been good carpenters,
the craft being passed down from generation to generation
within a special caste. Their shipbuilding has always
been superior to that of their neighbors, the Tongans.
It was not to be wondered at, therefore, that the main
department here should be that of wood-turning, and
some of the work the students were doing at the time
was exceptionally fine.</p>

<p>The buildings of the mission had all been constructed
with native labor under the direction of the missionaries.
They were simply but firmly built, the absence of architectural
richness being due fully as much to the spirit
of the missionaries as to the lack of decorativeness in
the character of the natives.</p>

<p>However, there was something to be found at the mission
which was harshly lacking at the sugar-mill. The
students moved about in a leisurely manner, cleanly and
thoughtful; whereas across the river not only were the
buildings of the very crudest possible, but the Hindus
and the Fijians roamed around like sullen, hungry curs
always expecting a kick. Those who were not sullen,
were obviously tired, spiritless, and repressed. Their
huts were set close to one another in rows, whereas the
mission buildings range over the hills. The crowding
at the mill, upon such vast open spaces, gave the little
village all the faults of a tenement district. Racial clannishness
seems to require even closer touch where space
is wide. The very expanse of the world seems to intensify
the fear of loneliness, so men huddle closer to sense
somewhat of the gregarious delights of over-populated
India. But there is also the squeezing of plantation-owners
here at fault, and the total disregard of the needs
of individual employees.</p>

<p>The mill is worked day and night, in season, but it is
at night that one's reactions to it are most impressive.
The street lamps, assisted by a dim glow from within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the shacks, the monotonous invocation of prayer by
Indians squatting before the wide-open doors, the tiny
kava "saloons," and the great, giant, grinding, grating
sugar-mills crushing the juice out of the cane and precipitating
it (after a chain of processes) in white dust
for sweetening the world, are something never to be forgotten.
The deep, pulsating breath of the mill sounded
like the snore of a sleeping monster. Yet that monstrous
mill never sleeps.</p>

<p class="caption">FOOD FOR A DAY'S GOSSIP</p>
</div>

<p>The sound did not cease, but rather, became more pronounced
after I returned that night. Deeply imprinted
on my memory was the figure of a sullen-looking Indian
at his post&mdash;small, wiry, persistent&mdash;with the whirring of
machinery all about him, the steaming vats, the broken
sticks of cane being crunched in the maw of the machine.
The toilers sometimes dozed at their tasks. I was told
that once an Indian fell into one of the vats in a moment
of dizzy slumber. The cynical informer insisted that the
management would not even stop the process of turning
cane into sugar, and that into the tea-cups of the world
was mixed the substance of that man. My reflection was
along different lines,&mdash;that into the sweets of the world
we were constantly mixing the souls of men.</p>


<h4>6</h4>

<p>But unfortunately those who look after the souls of
these men at the mission are apt to forget that they have
bodies, too, and that body is the materialization of desire.
There is something wonderful, indeed, in the sight of
men known to have been of the most ferocious of human
creatures going about their daily affairs in an attitude
of great reverence to the things of life. And reverence
added to the extreme shyness of the Fijian is writ large
in the manner of every native across the way from the
mill. Sometimes I felt that there was altogether too
much restraint, too much checking of wholesome and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
healthy impulses among them for it to be true reverence.
That was especially marked on Sunday morning, when
from all the corners of the mission fields gathered the
sturdy black men in the center of the grounds where
stood the little church.</p>

On board the launch going up the Rewa River, with shy Fijians all about</p>
</div>

<p>They were a sight to behold, altogether too seriously
concerned to be amusing, and to the unbiased the acme
of gentleness. There they were&mdash;muscular, huge, erect,
and black, their bushy crops of coarse hair adding six
inches to their heads; dressed in sulus neatly tucked
away, and stiff-bosomed white shirts over their bodies.
Starched white shirts in the tropics! And the Bible in
Fijian in their hands. In absolute silence they made
their way into the church, the shuffle of their unshod feet
adding intensity to that silence. When they raised their
voices in the hymns it seemed to me that nothing more
sincere had ever been sung in life. But then something
occurred which made me wonder.</p>

<p>From the Solomon Islands had come on furlough the
Rev. Mr. Ryecroft and his delicate wife. He was a man
of very gentle bearing and great fervor. He and
his plucky wife had suffered much for their convictions.
All men who really believe anything suffer. The missionary
is as much anathema in his field as the anarchist
is in America, and is generally as violent an agent for
the disruption of custom. Mr. Ryecroft rose to speak
before the congregation. He spoke in English and was
interpreted by the missionary in charge. He told of
his trials in the Solomon Islands, and appealed for Fijian
missionaries to go back with him and save the blood-thirsty
Solomons. I watched the faces of these converted
Fijians. Some of them were intent upon the speaker,
repugnance at the cruelties rehearsed coming over them
as at something of which they were more afraid as a
possible revival in themselves than as an objective danger.
Some, however, fell fast asleep, their languid heads
drooping to one side. I am no mind-reader, nor is my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
observation to be taken for more than mere guess-work,
but I felt that there were two conflicting thoughts in the
minds of the listeners, for while Mr. Ryecroft was urging
them to come arrest brutality in the Solomons there were
other recruiters at work in Fiji for service in Europe.
While one told that the savage Solomon Islanders
swooped down upon the missionary compound and left
sixteen dead behind them, in Europe they were leaving
a thousand times as many every day, worse than dead.
To whom were they to listen!</p>

<p>That afternoon Mr. Waterhouse, one of the missionaries,
asked me to give the young men a little talk on
my travels, he to interpret for me. I asked him what he
would like to have me tell them and he urged me to advise
them not to give up their lands. I complied, pointing
out to them how quickly they would go under as a race
if they did so. The response was more than compensating.</p>

<p>The outlook is all the more reassuring when you sit
of an evening as I did in the large, carefully woven native
house, elliptical in shape, with thatched roof and soft-matted
floors, which serves as a sort of night school for
little tots. The children, who were then rehearsing
some dances for the coming festival, sat on tiers of
benches so built that one child's feet were on a level
with the shoulders of the one in front. Like a palisade
of stars their bright eyes glistened with the reflections
of the light from the kerosene lamps hanging on wires
from the rafters. Lolohea Ratu, a girl of twenty, educated
in Sydney, Australia, spoke to them in a plaintive,
modulated voice, soft and low. All Fijian voices are
sad, but hers was slightly sadder than most of them,
tinged, it seemed, with knowledge of the world. She had
studied the Montessori method and was trying to train
her little brothers and sisters thereby. But she was not
forgetful of what is lovely in her own race, primitive as
it is, and was preparing these children in something of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
a compromise between native and foreign dances. Round
and round the room they marched, the overhanging lamps
playing pranks with their shadows. Others sat upon
the mats, legs crossed, beating time and clapping hands
in the native fashion. Their glistening bodies and sparkling,
mischievous eyes, their response to the enchanting
rhythm and melody borrowed from a world as strange
to them as theirs is to us, showed their delight. I wondered
what strange images&mdash;ghostly pale folk&mdash;they
were seeing through our songs. Perhaps the music was
merely another kind of "savage" song to them, even a
wee bit wilder than their own. On the following day
they were to sing and dance to the amazement of their
skeptical elders.</p>

<p>Thus does Fijian "civilization" steer its uncertain
course between the two contending influences from the
West&mdash;the planters and the missionaries&mdash;just as the
river Rewa runs between them over the jungle plains,
struggling to supplant wild entangling growths with
earth culture.</p>


<h4>7</h4>

<p>And that "civilization" leans at one time toward the
mill and at another toward the mission. Frankly, Fiji
grows more interesting as one gets away from these two
guy-wires and floats on the sluggish river. My opportunity
of seeing that Fiji which is least confused by either
influence came unexpectedly. The missionaries generously
invited me to go with them up the river in their
launch early Monday morning. Everywhere along the
banks of the broad, deep stream stood groups of huts
and villages amid the sugar-cane fields. I gazed up the
wide way of the river toward the hazy blue mountains
which stood fifty miles away. They seemed to be a thousand
miles and farther still from reality. The Himalayas
which lured the Lama priest and <i>Kim</i> could not
have been more enticing. Because of the cloying at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>mosphere
of the day, this distant coolness was like an
oasis in the desert, and I longed for some phantom ship
to bear me away on the breeze.</p>

</div>

<p>For twenty miles we glided on through cane plantations,
banana- and cocoanut-trees, and miniature palisades
here and there rising to the dignity of hills. We
landed, toward noon, at a village which stood on a little
plateau,&mdash;quiet, self-satisfied, though in no way elaborate.
The best of the huts stood against the hill across
the "street" formed by two rows of thatch-roofed and
leaf-walled huts. It belonged to the native Christian
teacher. He turned it over to us, himself and his wife
and baby disappearing while we lunched. Much of our
repast remaining, the missionary offered it to the
teacher, but I noticed that he looked displeased and
turned the platter over to the flock of children which
had gathered outside,&mdash;a brood of little fellows, their
bellies bulging out before them, not even the shadow of a
garment covering their nakedness.</p>

<p>I returned to the hut a little later for my camera, not
knowing that any one was there. Inside, in one corner,
lay the teacher's wife, stretched face downward, nursing
her baby, which lay on its back upon the soft mats. She
smiled, slightly embarrassed, and I withdrew. Here,
then, was the place where civilization and savagery met.</p>

<p>There were few Fijians in the village, mostly children
and several old women. A Solomon Islander, who had
got there during the days when blackbirding or kidnapping
was common, moved among them. He had quite
forgotten his own language and could not understand
Mr. Ryecroft when the missionary spoke to him. An
elderly man beckoned to me from his hut and there offered
to sell me a heavy, ebony carved club that could
kill an ox, swearing by all the taboos that it was a sacred
club and had killed many a man in his father's time.</p>

<p>A narrow path climbing the hill close behind the village
led us to a view over the long sweep of the river
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and its valley. The utmost of peace and tranquillity
hung, without a tremor, below us. Twenty huts fringed
the plateau, forming a vague ellipse, interwoven with
lovely salvias, coleuses, and begonias. The village seemed
to have been caught in the crook of the river, while a
field of sugar-cane filled the plain across the stream,
the shaggy mountains quartering it from the rear. Distant,
reaching toward the sun, ranged the mountains
from which the river is daily born anew.</p>

The only things some of these had on were sores on the tops of their heads</p>
</div>

<p>As our launch chugged steadily, easily down-stream,
and the evening shadows overstepped the sun, Fiji
emerged fresh and sweet as I had not seen it before. The
missionaries, till then sober and reserved, relaxed, the
men's heads in the laps of their wives. Sentimental
songs of long ago, like a stream of soft desire through
the years, supplanted precept in their minds, and I realized
for the first time why some men chose to be missionaries.
It was to them no hardship. The trials and
sufferings were romance to their natures, and the giving
up of everything for Christ was after all only living out
that world-old truism that in order to have life one must
be ready to surrender it.</p>


<h4>8</h4>

<p>Next day Mr. Waterhouse and I wandered about the
village of the sugar factory. At the bidding of several
minor chiefs who had described a circle on the mats, we
entered one of the dark huts by way of a low door. In a
corner a woman tended the open fire, and near an opening
a girl sat munching. The room was thick with smoke,
the thin reeds supporting the roof glistening with soot.
Everything was in order and according to form. They
were making <i>kava</i> (or <i>ava</i> or <i>yangana</i>), the native drink.
This used to be the work of the chieftain's daughter, who
ground the ava root with her teeth and then mixed it
with water. The law doesn't permit this now; so it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
crushed in a mortar (<i>tonoa</i>). Specialization has reached
out its tentacles even to this place, so that now the captain
of this industry is an Indian.</p>

<p>The ava mixed, it was passed round in a well-scraped
cocoanut-shell cut in half. As guests we were offered
the first drink. Extremely bitter, it is nevertheless refreshing.
After I made a pretense of drinking, the
bowl was passed to the most respected chief. With
gracious self-restraint he declined it. "This is too full.
You have given me altogether too much." A little bit
of it was poured back, and he drank it with one gulp.
He would really have liked twice as much, not half, but
there is more modesty and decorum among savages than
we imagine. In fact, our conventions are often only
atrophied taboos.</p>

<p>But the women, not so handsome nor so elegantly
coifed as the men, were excluded from a share in the
toast. They were not even part of the entertainment.
The sexes seldom meet in any form of social intercourse.
The boys never flirt with the girls, nor do they ever seem
to notice them. In public there is a never-diminishing
distance between them. A world without love-making,
primitive life is outwardly not so romantic as is ours.
The "romance" is generally that of the foreigner with
the native women, not among the natives themselves.</p>

<p>The daughter of the biggest living Fijian chief wandered
about like an outcast. She wore a red Mother-Hubbard
gown, and nothing else. Her hair hung down
to her shoulders. Having gone through the process of
discoloration by the application of lime, according to the
custom among the natives in the tropics, it was reddish
and stiff, but, being long, had none of the leonine quality
of the men's hair. Andi Cacarini (Fijian for Katherine),
daughter of a modern chief, spoke fairly good English.
She wasn't exactly ashamed, but just shy. The better
class of Fijians, they who have come in contact with white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
people, all manifest a timid reticence. Andi Cacarini
was shy, but hardly what one could call bashful or fastidious.
She posed for me as though an artist's model,
not at all ungraceful in her carriage or her walk.</p>

<p>The male Fijian is extremely timid, but none the less
fastidious. The care with which he trains and curls his
hair would serve as an object-lesson to the impatient
husband of the vainest of white women. This doesn't
mean that the Fijian man is effeminate in his ways, but
he is particular about his hair. The process of discoloring
it is exact. A mixture of burnt coral with water
makes a fine substitute for soap. When washed out and
dried, the hair is curled and combed and anointed. From
the point of view of sanitation, the treatment is excellent,
and from that of art&mdash;just watch the proud male
pass down the road!</p>

<p>No matter where one goes in Fiji&mdash;or any of the South
Sea Islands&mdash;the dance goes with one. Here at Davuilevu
one afternoon in the hot, scorching sun, the natives
gathered on the turf for merrymaking. It was no special
holiday, no unusual event. To our way of thinking it is
a tame sort of dance they do. We hear much of the
freedom between the sexes in the tropics, and one gains
the impression that there are absolutely no taboos. But
just as there is nothing in all Japan&mdash;however delightful&mdash;to
compensate the child, or even grown-ups, for the
lack of the kiss, so none of the Fijian dances fill that
same emotional requirement which with us is secured
through the embrace of men and women in the dance.
From the Fijian point of view, the whirling of couples
about together must be extremely immodest, if not immoral.</p>

<p>Sitting in a double row, one in front of the other, were
oiled and garlanded Fijians. Behind them and in a circle
sat a number of singers and lali-players. As they
began beating time, the oiled natives began to move from
side to side rhythmically. Their arms and bodies jerked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in a most fascinating and interpretative manner. No
voices in the wide world are lovelier than the voices of
Fijians in chorus; no other music issues so purely as the
Fijian music from the depths of racial experience. Sometimes
the dancers swung half-way round from side to
side, with arms akimbo, or extended their arms in all directions,
clapping their hands while chanting in soothing,
melodious deep tones.</p>

<p>Judging from what I heard of the music of the Tongans,
the Samoans, and the Fijians, I give the prize to
the Fijians for richness of tone. More primitive than
the plaintive Tongans, the Fijian music is a weird combination
of the intellectual, the martial, and the industrial,&mdash;more
fascinating than the passionate, voluptuous
tunes and dances of the Samoans and the Hawaiians.
The Polynesians, probably because of their close kinship
with the Europeans, are much more sentimental in their
music. The Fijian is more vigorous and to me more
truly artistic.</p>

<p>No study, it seems to me, would throw more light on
the history and unity of the human race than that of the
dance and music. Why two races so far apart as the
Japanese and the Maories of New Zealand should be so
strikingly alike in their cruder dances, is hard to say.
And the Fijians seem in some way the link between these
two. The Fijian doubtless inherits some of his musical
qualities from his negroid mixture, but he has certainly
improved upon it if that is so. He has no regrets, no
sentimental longings, and in consequence his songs are
free from racial affectation.</p>

<p>The Fijians always sing. The instant the day's work
is done and groups form they begin to sing. Half a
dozen of them sit down and cross their legs before them,
each places a stick so that one end rests lightly on one
toe, the other on the ground; and while they tap upon
these sticks, others sing and clap hands, swaying in an
enchantment of loveliness. One carries the melody in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
strained tenor, the others support him with a bass drawl.
Once in a while an instrument is secured, as a flute, and
the ensemble is complete. Even the tapping on the
stick becomes instrumental in its quality.</p>

<p>As the day draws to a close, from the cane-fields smoke
rises in all directions. The plantation workers have
gathered piles of cane refuse for destruction. Like miniature
volcanoes, these, with the coming of darkness,
shine in the lightless night. It makes one slightly sad,
this clearing away of the remnants of daily toil, this
purification by fire. Then the sound of that other lali
(the hollow tree-trunk), once the war-alarum or call to a
cannibal feast, now at Davuilevu the invitation to prayer,
the dampness, and the sense of crowding things in
growth,&mdash;this is what will ever remain vivid to me.</p>


<h4>9</h4>

<p>Poor untroubled Fijians! This simple love of harmony,
a majestic sense of force and brutality,&mdash;yet,
withal, so na&iuml;ve, withal so easily satisfied, so easily led.
Once a foreigner met a native who seemed in great haste
and trembling. The native inquired the time, in dread
lest he miss the launch for Suva. In his hand he carried
a warrant for his own arrest, with instructions to present
himself at jail. When the foreigner told him that it
was up to the jailer to worry about it, he seemed greatly
shocked. One of the missionaries had been asked to
keep his eye on a friend's house. In the absence of the
owner, the missionary found a Fijian in the act of burglarizing.
When questioned it was found that the native
wanted to get into jail, where he was sure of three meals
and shade, without worry. This is almost worthy of
civilized man, by whom it is perhaps more commonly
practised.</p>

<p>But the kind of jail in which men were at that time
incarcerated was not enough to frighten the most liberty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>-loving
individual. Because of the humidity and dampness,
the structure was left open on one side, only three
substantial walls and a roof being practical. Before the
white man got full control and the native had some iron
injected into his nature, it was not an arduous life the
prisoners led. The missionary told me that once the
head jailer was found sitting out of sight, with the officer
in charge of the prisoners, tilting his chair against the
wall of the jail. The prisoners had been ordered to
labor. The officer in charge was to execute the command.
Between puffs of tobacco, he would shout: "Up
shot!" and rest a while; then "Down shot!"&mdash;more rest.
Not a prisoner moved a muscle, the weights never rose
from the ground. The men were deep within the
shadows. The period of punishment over, they were ordered
into their heaven of still more rest and more shade.</p>

<p>From our way of thinking, these are flagrant deceptions.
But to the Fijian (and to most South Sea races)
the inducements for greater exertion are simply non-existent.
His revelries have been tabooed, his wars
have been stopped, his native arts are in constant competition
with cheap importations from our commercialized,
industrialized world. What is there, then, for him
to do? Little wonder that his native indifference to life
is growing upon him. His conception of life after death
never held many horrors. Even in the fierce old days it
was easy for a Fijian to announce most casually that he
would die at eight o'clock the following day. He would
be oiled and made ready, and at the stated time he died.
Most likely a state of catalepsy, but he was buried and
none thought a second time about it. One boy was recently
roused from such a condition and still lives.</p>

<p>The only means of counteracting this apathy are education
and the awakening of ambition through manual
training and the teaching of trades. This, the head of
the mission told me, was his main object. Missionary
efforts, according to one man, were directed more to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
purpose than to the inculcation of any special religious
precepts. And there is no question that that will work.
The will to live may yet spring afresh in the Fijian.</p>

<p>From the nucleus formed by the mission is growing a
more elaborate educational system. Recently the several
existing schools have been amalgamated under a new ordinance.
A proposal in reference to a more efficient system
of vernacular or sub-primary schools was embodied
in a bill put before the legislative council. A more satisfactory
method of training teachers was deliberated upon.
The Fijians are, it is seen, outgrowing the kindergarten
stage, but the grown-ups are largely children still.</p>


<h4>10</h4>

<p>A fortnight after I landed in Suva I was steaming for
Levuka, the former capital of the islands, situated on
a much smaller land-drop not many hours' journey away.
These are the only two important ports in the group,
and inter-island vessels seldom go to one without visiting
the other. Levuka is a much prettier place than
Suva. Its little clusters of homes and buildings seem
to have dug their heels into the hillside to keep from
sliding into the sea.</p>

<p>Along the shore to the left stood a group of Fijian
huts,&mdash;a suburb of Levuka, no doubt. Only a few old
women were at home, and one old man. Nothing in the
wide world is more restful to one's spirit than to arrive
at a village which is deserted of toilers. Nothing is
more symbolic of the true nature of home, the village
being more than an isolated home, but a composite of
the home spirit which is not tainted by any evidence of
barter and trade.</p>

<p>On the other side of Levuka, however, was an altogether
different kind of village, that of the shipwrights.
Upon dry-docks stood the skeletons of ships, fashioned
with hands of love and ambition. In such vessels these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
ancient rovers of the sea wandered from island to island,
learning, teaching, mixing, and disturbing the sweetness
of nature, with which no race on earth was more blessed.</p>

<p>The <i>Atua</i>, on which I had sailed from Suva, was a
fairly large inter-island steamer that made the rounds
of all the important groups. She was bound for Samoa,
whither I had determined to go. There is no better opportunity
of getting a glimpse of the contrast between
the natives of the various South Sea islands than on
board one of these inter-island vessels. They are generally
manned by the natives of one of the groups,&mdash;in
this case, the Fijians. These men handle the cargo at
all ports, and remain on board until the vessel returns
to Fiji en route to the Antipodes. They feed and sleep
on the open deck and make themselves as happy and as
noisy as they can. A gasoline tin of tea, baked potatoes,
hard biscuit, and a chunk of fat meat, which is all placed
before them on the dirty deck (they are given no napkins),&mdash;that
is Fijian joy.</p>

<p>After their work, which in port sometimes keeps them
up till the morning hours, these strange creatures, untroubled
by thought, stretch themselves on the wooden
hatchway and sleep. There I found them at half-past
five in the morning, all covered with the one large sheet
of canvas and never a nose poking out. Air! Perhaps
they got some through a little hole in the great sheet.
Some stood and slept like tired, overworked horses.</p>

<p>One queer Fijian with turbaned head grinned in imitation
of none other than himself, a vague, undefined
curiosity rolling about in his skull. He followed me
everywhere, his white eyes staring and his mouth wide
open. Here was a future Fijian statesman in the process
of formation. His nebular, chaotic mentality was
taking note of a creature as far removed from his understanding
as a star from his reach.</p>

<p>One white soldier, an elderly man, wished to protect
himself from the wind, and asked a Fijian to haul over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
a piece of canvas. The black man did so, but when the
boatswain saw it, he was enraged. The Fijian took all
the scolding, said never a word, and quickly replaced the
sheet. As the boatswain moved away, the soldier handed
the native a cigarette, saying: "Have one of these, old
sport. One must expect reverses in war." The native
grinned and felt the row was worth while.</p>

</div>

<p>There were Tongans, Indians, Samoans, and whites
on board, and though these are nearer kin to us, I liked
the Fijians most. Yet the Tongans are an attractive lot,
refined in feature, in manner, and in person. Perhaps
that is why they have the distinction of being the only
South Sea people with their own kingdom, a cabinet, and
a parliament.</p>

<p>The noise the Fijians make while in port is excruciating.
It is something unclassifiable. They roll their r's,
shout as though mad with anger, and then burst out in
childish laughter at nothing. These boyish barbarians
enjoy themselves much more in yelling than they would
in chorus with a Caruso. How torrential is the stream
of invective which issues against some fellow-laborer!
With what a terrific crash it falls upon its victim! But
how utter the disappointment when, after one has expectantly
waited for a scrap, a gurgle of hilarity breaks
from the throats which the moment before seemed such
sirens of hate and malice!</p>

<p>And so they toil, happy to appear important, busy,
honestly busy, loading the thousands of crates of green
bananas, the cargo which passes to and fro. Happier
than the happiest, sharing the scraps of a meal without
the growl so common among our sailors, each always
seems to get just what he wants and helps in the distribution
of the portions to the others. The missus never
bothers him, no matter how long he is away, and instantly
labor ceases the group is "spiritualized" into a singing
society and the racial opera is in full swing.</p>

<p>I had anticipated relief at their absence when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
steamer set off for the colder regions south. Yet something
pleasant was gone out of life the moment the ship
steamed out. The sailors moved about like pale ghosts
who had mechanically wandered back to a joyless life.
The white man's virtues are his burdens. His tasks
are done so that he may purchase pleasure. The ship
was orderly, everything took its place, even the cursing
and yelling came within control. We were heading
again for civilization.</p>

<p>I felt somewhat like the old folks after their wish had
rid the town of all mischievous little boys, and my heart
strained back for an inward glimpse of the life behind.
The smell of mold and copra returned; the damp beds;
the cool, clear night air; the moonlight upon the shallow
reefs; dappled gray breakers, playing upon the shore as
upon a child's ocean; in the dark, along Victoria Parade,
the shuffle of bare feet in the dust, the dim figures of tall,
bushy-haired men and slim, wiry Hindus; the thud of
heeled boots on the dry earth. And far off there, the
sound of the lali, the singing of deep voices, the vision
of an earthly paradise,&mdash;shattered by the sighting of
land ahead.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE SENTIMENTAL SAMOANS</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>On the <i>Niagara</i> was a troupe of Samoan men and
women who had been to San Francisco demonstrating
their arts at the Panama-Pacific Exhibition. This,
our meeting on the wide, syrup-like tropical sea seemed
to me almost a welcome, a coming out to greet me and
to lead me to the portals of their home. They were en
route to Suva, Fiji, where they were to await an inter-island
vessel to take them to Samoa. They were traveling
third class, and the way I discovered them is not to their
discredit. We were becoming more or less bored with
life on deck, the games of ship tennis and quoits being
too obviously make-believe to be entertaining. At times
I would get as far away from the gregarious passengers
as possible, and again a number of us would gather upon
the hatchway and read or chatter. It was a thick latticed
covering, and the warm air from below none too
agreeable. But with it rose strains of strange melodies,
as from Neptune's regions of the deep. Peering down,
we espied a number of Samoan men and women, lounging
upon the floor of the hold. We took our reputations in
our hands and made the descent.</p>

<p>There were big, burly men and broad, sprawling
women, half-naked and asleep. One could see at a glance
that they had been spoiled by the attention they had received
while on exhibition at the fair, but the freedom
of life among third-class passengers somewhat softened
the acquired stiffness, and they relaxed again into native
ways. Hour by hour, as the vessel moved southward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
they seemed to come back to life, to thaw out as it were,
while we were wilting by degrees.</p>

<p>The scene was one which could have been found only
in tropical waters under the burning sun. Smoke, bare
feet, nakedness, people fat with the sprawly fatness which
is the style of the South Seas, unwashed sailors,&mdash;a
medley of people and cargo and steamer stench. But
also of the sweetly monotonous song of the Samoan girl,
the swishing of the water against the nose of the ship
in the twilight without, and the steady push of the vessel
toward the equator.</p>

<p>I whiled away many a pleasant hour, learning a few
of the native words in song and gossip. It is hard to distinguish
one native from the other at first, but Fulaanu
stood out above the rest like a creature over-imbued with
good-nature. She was flat, flabby, with a drawl in speech
that had the effect not only in her voice but her entire
bearing of a leaning Tower of Pisa. Her body bent
backward, her head was tilted up, and her long, prominent
nose also slanted almost with pride. She was an enormous
girl, plain, soft, with absolutely no fighting-spirit
in her, but she stood her ground against all masculine
advances with a charm that was in itself teasingly alluring.
She was always flanked on each side by a sailor.
They pretended to teach her the ukulele, they proffered
English lessons, they found one excuse after another for
being near her, and she never shooed them away; but
I'd swear by all the gods that not one of them ever more
than held her hand or leaned lovingly against her.</p>

<p>Yet Fulaanu was as sentimental a maiden as I have
ever laid eyes on. She was constantly drawling some sentimental
song she had learned in California, the ukulele
was seldom out of her hands, she never joined in any
of the card games going on constantly roundabout her,
and she was always ready to swap songs with any one
willing to teach her.</p>

<p>"I teach you my language," she said to me, and slowly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with twinkling eyes, she pronounced certain words which
I repeated. We had often taught French to our boys
at our little school in California in that way,&mdash;the Marseillaise,
for instance,&mdash;and the method was not strange
to me. She used the song method, too, an old English
song that was just then the rage in Samoa. The English
words run somewhat like this:</p>

<p class="poem">
And you will take my hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you did when you took my name;</span><br />
But it's only a beautiful picture,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a beautiful golden frame.</span><br />
</p>

<p>I'm sure I have them all muddled, but let me hum this
tune to myself and immediately Fulaanu, the hold,
Fiji, Samoa, and all the scents and sounds of savagedom
come instantly to my mind. For everywhere I went
they were singing this song, through their noses but with
all the sentimental ardor of the young flapper; as at a
summer resort in America when a new song hit has been
made, the sound of it is heard from delivery boy to housemaid
and as many different renderings of it as individual
temperament demands.</p>

<p>There was Setu, too,&mdash;tall, straight, with that easy
grace known only among people free of clothes. Setu
spoke English very well, and was as companionable a
chap as one could pick up in many a mile. But Setu's
heart was not his own; he stood guardian over a treasure
he had found in San Francisco. Not an American girl,
no, sir! These savage boys did not play the devil in our
land as our savages do in theirs. But Setu was the personification
of chivalry, and, what was more, he was in
love. To look at him and then at her was to despair of
human instinct of natural selection. How an Apollo of
his excellence should have been unable to find a more
handsome objet d'amour, I cannot imagine. She was
short, well rounded, with a head as square as Fulaanu's
was oblong, and a nose as snubby as Fulaanu's was romanesque.
She was evidently committed, body and soul,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
to Setu for she was as devoid of charm for the others
as Fulaanu was full of it. And so all day long, Setu and
his sweetheart hugged each other in a corner, as oblivious
of the presence of a ship-load of people as though
they had been ensconced in a hut of their own. They
were evidently taking advantage of proximity to civilization,
for such immodest behavior is not frequent in the
tropics. Civilization had taught the savages some things
at least. Whenever Setu was free from love-making, he
would spare a moment to me, and on those rare occasions
he stirred my spirit with promises of guidance in
his native island that threatened to exhaust my funds.</p>

<p>The romantic associations we have with the South Seas
were in this group reversed, for to these primitive people
the greatest romance imaginable came with their
journey to America. There young people from different
islands met and fell in love with one another; there, under
the benign influence of American spooning, one couple
was married, and there their first baby was born,&mdash;an
American subject, brought back to Pago Pago (American
Samoa) to resume his citizenship. There they learned
true modesty, which comprised stockings and heavy
boys' shoes; the art of playing solitaire, in which one fat,
matronly-looking woman indulged all day as though she
had been brought along as chaperon and felt herself
considerably out of it; and even en route for home they
were learning the art of striking by calculation and without
passion or frenzy.</p>

<p>I was sitting on the hatch with Fulaanu, who was strumming
away on her ukulele, when a ring was formed in the
middle of the hold and a young white man began boxing
with a Samoan. The white boxer was obviously an
amateur, bearing himself with all the unpleasant mannerisms
of his profession,&mdash;a haughty, pugnacious, overbearing
self-conceit. He had every advantage in training
over his antagonist, whom he peppered vigorously.
He kept it up when it was evident that the young Samoan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
was going under. One last blow and the fellow doubled
over, bleeding from nose and mouth. It took ten minutes
to bring him round. In the meanwhile, the victor
of the unfair bout strutted around as though he had
accomplished something remarkable.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see the effect this had on the
"primitive" Samoans. There was consternation among
them; a hush came over the hold. The vibration of the
steamer and the splashing of the water against its iron
side alone broke the stillness. The Samoan girls, though
they did not grow hysterical, were most decidedly displeased,
turning in disgust from the sight of blood.
Yet according to our notions they are primitive, and the
fact is that a few generations ago they were savages.</p>

<p>But they were not long in distress. The spell of the
equatorial sun was upon them, and they soon relaxed.
There upon mats, as in their own huts, lay rows of fat,
large, voluptuous men and women; nor was there even a
rope to separate the sexes as in an up-to-date Japanese
bath. They seemed to sleep all day, in shifts governed
by impulse only. A woman would rise and move about
a while, then go back to lounge again. Enormous, broad-shouldered
and black mustached men would snore
gently, rise and inspect life, and decide that slumber
was better for one's soul. But Fulaanu lounged with her
ukulele, surrounded by amorous sailors who gazed
longingly into her eyes.</p>

<p>One night we arranged for a meeting of the "classes."
We promised the Samoans a good collection if they would
come and dance for us on deck. We invited the first-class
folk to come, too. They stood as far to one side of
us as was consonant with first-class dignity represented
by an extra few pounds sterling in the price of the ticket.
But for a moment we forgot that there were class and
race in the world.</p>

<p>It was not one of those interminable revelries one
reads about, that begin with twilight and end with twi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>light.
On the contrary, it was a little squall of entertainment,
one that breaks out of a clear sky and leaves
the sky just as clear in a trice. There was no occasion
for self-expression here. They had been asked to dance
for our entertainment, not for theirs. There we stood,
ready to applaud; there they were, ready to be applauded,
to receive the collection promised. It was another little
thing they had picked up in our world, from our civilization,&mdash;the
commercialization of art. Our artists,
scribes, and entertainers have been considerably raised
above prostitution of their talents by a certain commercialization,
by the translation of their worth in dollars
and cents; and we need a little more of it to free art from
bondage to patronage. But in the tropics, where the
dance and jollity are no private matters, there is something
sterile in commercialization. No doubt to the natives
there is little difference between a woman giving
herself for gain and a man dancing for the money there
is in it without the whole group becoming part of the
performance: the dancer feels that his purchaser, his
public, is cold and unresponsive. And so it seemed to me
at this dance. They finished, they expected their money,
they got it and departed, and there seemed something
immoral to me in the exploitation of their emotions.</p>

<p>What a different lot they were one night when I visited
the little house they rented in Suva while waiting for the
<i>Atua</i> to arrive from New Zealand and take them on to
Samoa. There it was song and dance out of sheer ecstasy:
life was so full. They were again in their home
atmosphere, and their voices only helped swell the volume
of song which issued forth everywhere about,&mdash;an
electrification of humanity all along the line, in village
after village.</p>

<p>They hung about the pier before sailing for Samoa
till after midnight, singing sentimental songs and hobnobbing
with the Fijians. The Fijian constable joined
them with a flute, and the lot of them tried to drown out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the voices of the natives loading and unloading cargo.
Not until notice was given that the ship was about to get
under steam did they think of going aboard. They
looked as though ready for rest, but by no means dissipated,
by no means weary. The spell of song was still
upon them.</p>

<p>When we woke next morning, we were tied up to a pier
at the foot of the hills of Levuka. But I have already
dwelt upon the features of this former capital, and am
only concerned with it here as it was reflected in the
eyes of the Samoans. Levuka to me was one thing; to
them it was quite another. The moldy little stores afforded
them more interest than the village to the left,
or the shipyards to the right which were to my Western
notions commendable.</p>

<p>I followed in the wake of these gliding natives as we
left the steamer. They looked neither to the right nor
to the left, but wended their ways, like cattle in the pasture,
straight toward the shops. Into one and out the
other they went, bargaining, pricing, buying little trinkets
and simple cloths, chatting with the Fijians as
though friends of old.</p>

<p>Setu's sweetheart and the pretty mother of the young
American citizen, who was left in the care of the fat
"chaperon," set off by themselves through the one and
only street of Levuka. It was obvious that they were
quite aware of whither they were going,&mdash;so direct was
their journey. My curiosity was roused and I wandered
along with them. They said never a word to me, nor
objected to my presence. We turned to the left, off into
a side street that began to insinuate its way along the
bed of a stream lined with wooden huts and shacks.
Some of these were fairly well constructed, with verandas,
like the houses of a miniature American town,
garlanded in flowers. Just above the village, where the
stream began to emerge from behind a rocky little gorge,
the two women turned in at a gate to a private cottage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
A bridge led across the stream to the little house, the
veranda of which extended slightly over the stream.
Beneath, in a corner formed by a projecting boulder, lay
a quiet little pool of water&mdash;clear, cool, fresh and deep.</p>

<p>Without asking permission from the owners, the
women began slowly, cautiously to wade into the pool.
Seeing that I had no thought of going, they put modesty
aside, slipped the loose garments down to their waists
and immersed themselves up to their necks. One of
them was tattooed from below her breasts to her hips;
the other's breasts alone bore these designs. They
dipped and rose, splashed and spluttered, but there was
none of that intimacy with their own flesh which is the
essence of cleanliness and passion in our world. There
was no soap, no scrubbing. It was something objective,
almost, a contact with nature like looking at a landscape
or listening to a storm.</p>

<p>Presently some of the inmates of the cottage, evidently
well-to-do Fijians, came out to greet them. I could not
tell whether they were friends or not, but the women
were invited in,&mdash;and I turned into town through back
roads and alleys that were just like the back roads and
alleys anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>That afternoon we steamed out again for Apia, Samoa.
The sea was disturbed somewhat and gave us various
sensations; but the vile odors that threatened my nautical
pride never changed.</p>

<p>Most of the Samoans were under the weather. They
did not look cheerful, and all song was gone out of them.
Setu and his sweetheart were here even more inseparable
than on the <i>Niagara</i>. She was not very well and
stretched out on the bench on the edge of which he took
his seat. In her squeamish condition she could hardly
be expected to pay much attention to proprieties she had
acquired in less than a year's residence in America.
Her sprawly bare feet on several occasions made too
bold an exit from beneath the loose Mother-Hubbard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
gown she wore, and each time Setu would draw the skirt
farther over them, affectionately pressing them with his
hand. This one instance, exceptional as it was, made me
notice more consciously the absence of that public
intimacy which is the bane of the prude with us. Not all
the charm of the tropics which is so real to me can take
the place of the cleanliness of the West, the tenderness
of clean men and women in public, to be observed even on
our crowded subways, the loveliness of white skin tinged
with pink and scented with the essence of flowers.</p>

<p>I did not see them again before we arrived at Samoa
the next day; the sea was too choppy. But in the afternoon
Setu came out with a pillow held aloft over his head,
and declared he would take a nap. There was childish
glee in his face at the prospect, and he stretched out on
the hard deck in perfect ease. And long after I ceased
to figure in his fancies, the beaming, sparkling eyes and
merry grin seemed to light up the soul within him.</p>

<p>Toward sundown we passed the first island of the
group,&mdash;Savaii, the largest. It lay at our left, Mua Peak
emitting a sluggish smoke from reaches beyond the depth
of the waters which had nearly submerged it, and as the
sea made furious charges into blow-holes or half-submerged
caverns, the earth spit back the invading waters
with an easy contempt.</p>

<p>At our right lay the island of Manono, much smaller,
and nearer our course. Shy Samoan villages hid in
little ravines, almost afraid to show their faces.</p>

<p>Shortly after eight o'clock we neared the island of
Upolu. The troupe of Samoans came out on deck with
the eagerness in their eyes that marks such arrivals at
every port of the world. The lights of the village of
Apia pricked the delicate evening haze. One strong,
steady lamp, like a planet, shone from above the others.
Setu called to me eagerly, his right hand pointing
toward it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is from Vailima, Stevenson's home," he said,
with some pride.</p>

<p>When at last we anchored just outside the reefs before
Apia, these natives, who had grown close to one another
during the year of their pilgrimage, began bidding one
another farewell before slipping back to the little separate
grooves they called home. The women kissed one
another, cheek touching cheek at an angle, a practice
common both at meeting (<i>talofa</i>) and at parting (<i>tofa</i>).
But with the men they only shook hands. Then, clambering
over into canoes, they were borne across the reefs
to their homes. And as long as Polynesia is Polynesia
there will echo the stories of this journey to the land of
the white man and all children will know that what the
white man said about his lands is true.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>The reader who has never entered a strange port nor
come home from foreign lands will not be able to imagine
the psychological effect of my entry of Samoa. Not only
did the thousands of eyes of the natives seem to turn
their gaze upon me, but it seemed, and I was quite sure,
that at least two thousand pale faces with as many bayonets
were fixed upon me. Samoa was under occupation.
I asked the captain of the forces what I could do to
avoid trouble.</p>

<p>"See that you don't get shot," he said. I assured him
there was nothing nearer my heart's desire, and, seeing
that I looked harmless, he ventured to reassure me: "Oh,
just keep away from the wireless. That's all." I had
come to see the natives, not electric gymnastics, so I
found it very easy to keep away from the wireless.</p>

<p>What there was of Apia was essentially European and
lay along the waterfront. Here stood the three-story
hotel, built and until then managed by Germans. Diagonally
across from it and nearer the water's edge, was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
two-story ramshackle building even then run by Germans.
The little barber to whom I had been directed
spoke with a most decided German accent. He cut and
shampooed my hair, but let me walk out with as much
of a souse on top of my head as I ever had in a shower-bath.
Wherever I went were Germans,&mdash;and yet they
said the islands were under occupation. Turn to the
right and there, back off the street within a small compound
that seemed to lie flat and low, was a German
school still being conducted by black-bearded German
priests. But to the left, within the dark-red fence, stood
the dark-red buildings of the German Plantation Company,
closed, and the little building that once was
the German Club had become the British Club; while at
the other end of the street were the office buildings of
the military staff, where once ruled the German militarists.
In between, in a little building a block or two
behind the waterfront, was the printing-office,&mdash;where,
strange to say, the daily paper was still being printed in
both German and English. With the few structures that
filled in the gaps between these outposts we had small
concern. They were the nests of traders, the haven of
so-called beach-combers and the barracks and missionary
compounds. And alien Samoa is at an end.</p>

<p>Mindful of the mild instructions not to get myself shot,
I took as little interest in the details of occupation as
was compatible with my sense of freedom; but this course
was precarious, for at the time any one who was not
with us was against us. However, details of such differences
must be reserved for a later chapter. Here we
are interested in Samoa itself. But in my very interest
in the place I struck a snag, for every other day Germans
were being deported or coraled for attempting to stir
up a native uprising. Still, inasmuch as I could not
acquire the language in so short a time, I felt secure, and
took to the paths that led to the Stone Age as a Dante
without a love-affair to guide him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The island is hemmed in by coral reefs on the edge of
which the waves break, spreading in foam and gliding
quietly toward shore. As they sport in the brilliant sunlight,
it seems as though the sea were calling back the
life lost to it through evolution. The tall, gaunt palms
which lean toward the sea, bow in a humble helplessness.
There, a quarter of a mile out, upon the unseen reefs,
lies the iron skeleton of the <i>Adler</i>, the German man-of-war
which was wrecked on the memorable day in 1889.
Such seems to be the fate of the Germans: even their
skeletons outlive disaster. But the sea has been the
protector of the natives. It would be interesting to
speculate as to what course events about the South Seas
would have taken had not that hurricane intervened.
The natives are indifferent to such speculations; for, as
far as they were concerned, one turn was as good as
another. Borne over the swelling waves from island
drift to island drift, the ups and downs of eternity seem
to leave no great changes in their lives.</p>

<p>Roaming along the waterfront to the left of Apia
with the sun near high noon, all by myself, I met with
nothing to disturb the utter sweetness and glory of life
about. I wavered between moods of exquisite exhilaration
and deep depression. Bound by the encircling consciousness
of the occupation, the sense of wrong done
these natives who had neither asked for our civilization
nor invited us to squabble over their "bones," I felt that
but for the presence of the white man this would have
been the loveliest land in the world. For here one
becomes aware of nature as something altogether different
from nature anywhere else. That distant pleading
of the sea; the gentle yielding of the palms to the landborn
breezes,&mdash;there was much more than peace and
ease; there was absolute harmony. But where was man?</p>

<p>I became restless. Nature was not sufficient. I went
to seek out man, for at that hour there was none of him
anywhere about. I was, for all intents and purposes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
absolutely the only human being on that island. Every
one else had taken to cool retreats. But where should I
go? I wondered. I knew no one, and the sense of loneliness
I had for a while forgotten came back to me with
a rush. For a moment I was again in civilization, again
in a world of fences and locked doors. "I will go and
look up Setu," I thought. "He promised to guide me
about Samoa. I have his address. I'll look up Setu."
So I turned back toward the hills and in among the palm
groves, where I could see the huts of the village of
Mulinuu, where Setu lived.</p>

<p>When I arrived I realized why I had suddenly become
conscious of my loneliness. Throughout the village there
wasn't a soul abroad. The domes of thatch resting on
circles of smooth pillars were deserted, it seemed, and
the fresh coolness that coursed freely within their shade
was untasted. Nowhere upon the broad, grassy fields
beneath the palms was there a walking thing; and I was
a total stranger. It was slightly bewildering, as though
I were in a graveyard, or a village from which the
inhabitants had all gone. I approached one of the huts
and found, to my satisfaction, that there was a human
being there. It was a woman, attending to her household
duties. She was just under the eaves on the outside,
beside the floor of the hut, which was like a circular stage
raised a foot or two above the ground, and paved with
loose shingles from the shore. I hardly knew how to
approach her, not thinking she might know my language.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," she said in perfect English. "Sit
down." The shock was pleasant. So there were no
fences or doors to social intercourse in Samoa, after all.
Still, I must find Setu. I asked her where I could locate
his home. Before directing me, she chatted a while and
assured me that I could go to any one of the huts about
and make myself comfortable. I was not to hesitate, as
it was the custom of the country and in no way unusual.
She was a fine-looking woman, robust and tall, genial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and attentive, as housewifely a person as could be found
anywhere. I have since had occasion to talk with many
a housewife in New Zealand and Australia when searching
for private quarters and cannot say that their manners,
their dress, their regard for a stranger's welfare
in any way exceeded those of this woman who had nothing
to offer me but rest and no wish for reward but my
content.</p>

<p>Taking her directions, I turned across the village to
where she said Setu could be found. Beneath the shade
of a palm squatted a group of men who when they spied
me called for me to come over to them. Had I not been
on curiosity bent, I should have regarded their request
as sheer impudence, for when I arrived they wanted me
to employ them as guides. It was amusing. Instead of
running after hire, they commanded the stranger to come
to them. It was too comfortable under the spreading
palm branches. I told them that I had arranged with
Setu to guide me and was in search of him. They began
running Setu down. He was untrustworthy, they assured
me, and would charge me too high a price. Then they
asked me what my business was, what Setu had said,
when he was going,&mdash;everything imaginable. But never
an inch would they move to show me the way to Setu's
house. I wandered about for a while, inquiring of one
stray individual and another, but no one had seen Setu,
and at last I learned that he had left the village early
that morning for his father's place, far inland, and
would not return. Setu had gone back on me. He had
promised to call for me with his horse and buggy and
convey me over the island. But Setu had forsaken me,
and there was nothing to do but to make the best of the
day right there.</p>

<p>Taking the word of the well-spoken woman, I
approached the most attractive-looking hut, where sat a
number of people roundabout the pillars. It was a
mansion-like establishment even to my inexperienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
judgment of huts. It was roofed with corrugated iron
instead of thatch, and the pillars were unusually straight
and smooth. The raised floor was very neatly spread
with selected, smooth, flat stones four to five inches in
diameter, and framed with a rim of concrete. Fine straw
mats lay like rugs over a polished parquet floor at all
angles to one another, and straw drop curtains hung
rolled up under the eaves, to be lowered in case of rain
or hurricane. The floor space must have been at least
thirty-five feet in diameter, and it was plain that each
inhabitant occupied his own section of the hut round the
outer circle.</p>

<p>I was cordially greeted and invited to rest, which I
did by sitting on the ground with my legs out, and my
back to a pillar for support. From the quiet and decorum
it was evident that the householders were entertaining
guests. Each couple or family sat upon its own mats.
There were twelve adults and three children. It happened
that the man who greeted me and bade me be
seated was the guest of honor, a gentleman from Rarotanga,
passing through Samoa on his way to Fiji. He
was a very refined-looking individual, and made me feel
that the Rarotangans were a superior race, but the contrary
is true. However, his regular features and courtly
manners were a distinction which might well have
led to such a supposition. His handsome wife, who sat
with him, was as retiring as a Japanese woman, and as
considerate of his comfort.</p>

<p>The others were set in pairs all round the hut. At
the extreme left were two women, sewing; opposite us,
a man and woman apportioning the victuals; to my
right, a man and a woman grinding the ava root preparatory
to the making of the drink. Farther way squatted
a very fat woman, with barely a covering over her
breasts, which were full as though she were in the nursing-stage.
The children moved about freely neither
disturbing nor being curbed. In the center of the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>pany
sat two men, one evidently the head of the family,
with his back up against a pillar, the other his equal in
some relationship.</p>

<p>The dinner was being served by a portly individual,
a man who could not have been exactly a servant, yet
who did not act as though he were a member of the
family. He passed round the ample supply of fish,
meats, and vegetables on enamel plates, his services
always being acknowledged graciously. No one looked
at or noticed his neighbor, but indulged with the aid of
spoon or finger as he saw fit, and had any made a <i>faux
pas</i> there would have been none the wiser. That, I
thought, was true politeness.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the remains were removed and each person
leaned back against the nearest pillar. After a slight
pause, the eldest man, he in the center of the hut, clapped
his hands, and uttered a gentle sound, as one satisfied
would say: "Well! Let's get down to business." But it
was nothing so serious or so material as that. It was
ava-drinking time. The polished cocoanut bowl was
passed round, by the same old waiter, to the man whose
name was called aloud by the head of the household, and
each time all the rest clapped hands two or three times to
cheer his cup. It was like the Japanese method of "ringing"
for a servant, not like our applause. Then fruits
were passed around. Cocoanuts, soft and ripe, the outer
shell like the skin of an alligator pear and easily cut with
an ordinary knife, were first in order, after which the
companion of the man in the middle of the hut, like a magician
on the stage, drew out of mysterious regions an
enormous pineapple which may have been thirty inches
in circumference. It might have had elephantiasis, for
all I knew, but it was the cause of the only bit of disharmony
I had noticed during the entire time I rested
with them. The man to whom it fell to dispense its juicy
contents&mdash;he who had sat unobtrusively beside the head
of the house now found it necessary to stretch his legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
in order the better to carve the fruity porcupine. The
shock to my sense of form the moment I caught sight
of those legs was enough to dissipate my greediest interest
in the pineapple. They were twice the size of the
fruit, and as knotty. He was suffering from elephantiasis
of the legs, poor man,&mdash;a disease, according to the
encyclop&aelig;dia, "dependent on chronic lymphatic obstruction,
and characterized by hypertrophy of the skin and
subcutaneous tissue." Morbid persons seem to enjoy
taking away with them photographs of people affected
by this hideous disease in various parts of the body, but
it was enough for me that I saw this one case; and sorry
enough was I that I saw it at that quiet, peaceful hut,
from which I should otherwise have carried away the
loveliest of memories.</p>

<p>For as soon as the meal was over, and the ava-drinking
at an end, pleasures more intellectual were in order.
Neighbors began to arrive, including the fine woman who
had urged me to rest wherever I wished. As each new
guest appeared, he passed round on the outside and
shook hands with those to whom he was introduced,
finally finding a quiet corner.</p>

<p>When the interruptions ceased, the head of the house
began to speak in a low, reflective tone of voice. All the
others relaxed, as do men and women over their cigarettes.
My Tongan neighbor acted as interpreter for me,
being the only person present who could speak English.
The head of the house was telling some family legend,
the point of which was the friendship between his forefathers
and the fathers of this Tongan guest. Then one
at a time, quietly, in a subdued tone, each one present
expressed his gratitude for the hospitality extended, or
recited some family reminiscence. There wasn't the
slightest affectation, nor the semblance of an argument.
Here, then, was Thoreau's principle of hospitality
actually being practised. As each one spoke he gazed
out upon the open sky decorated with the broad green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
leaves of the palm. Sometimes the listeners smiled at
some witticism, but most of the time they were interested
in a sober way. Last of all arose the companion of the
head of the house, upon his heavy, elephantine legs, and
in a dramatic manner&mdash;probably made to seem more so
by the tragic distortion of his limbs&mdash;related a story,
several times emphasizing a generalization by a sweep
of the hands toward the open world about.</p>

</div>

<p>A gentle breeze crept down from the hills and swept
its way among the pillars of this peaceful hut and
skipped on through the palms out to sea. As far as the
eye could reach through the village there was no sign
of uncleanliness, no stifling enclosures, no frills to catch
the unwary.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well-nigh gone when I moved
reluctantly away from this charmed spot. Slowly life
was becoming more discontented with ease and bestirred
itself to the satisfaction of wants. A few hours of toil,
in the gathering of fruits, and one phase of tropical life
was rounded out. It might be more pleasant to believe
that that is the only side, but such faith is treacherous.
The life of the average South Sea islander is as arduous
as any. Fruits there are usually a-plenty, but they must
be gathered and stored against famine and storm. Be
that as it may, the open life, the things one has which
require only wishing to make them one's own, the
uncramped open world,&mdash;by that much every man is
millionaire in the tropics, and it is pleasant to forget
if one can that there is exploitation, despoliation, and
oppression as well, both of native and of alien origin.
But for the time at least we may as well enjoy that
which is lovely.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>That night I witnessed the usual events at the British
Club. The substance of the evening's conversation,
every word of which was in my own language, was quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
foreign to me. It comprised "Dr. Funk" and his special
services in counteracting dengue fever. The aim and
object of every man there seemed to be to make me drink,
quite against my will. A visiting doctor added the
weight of his learning to induce me to turn from heedlessly
falling a victim to fever by engaging "Dr.
Funk." I was inclined to dub him "Dr. Bunk," but why
arouse animosity in the tropics? there is enough of it.</p>

<p>But I couldn't help contrasting in my own mind the
little gathering on the shingle-paved floor of that corrugated
iron hut with the more elaborate club that changed
its name from German to British with no little hauteur.
More than once I wished that I had had command of the
language of those people in the hut where allegory, mixed
with superstition but seasoned with gentle hospitality&mdash;and
not rum&mdash;was the order of the day.</p>

<p>Weary of refusing booze and more booze, I set off
for the shore. Though military order forbade either
natives or Germans or any one else without a permit to
be out after ten o'clock, I had had no difficulty in securing
a permit to roam about at will, day or night. The
new military Inspector of Police strolled out with me
and we took to the road that led out of Apia to the left,
past the barracks, past the school, and the church, past
all the crude replicas of our civilization.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I loathe it all!" said Heasley to me. "God,
what wouldn't I give to be back with my wife and kiddies!
This everlasting boozing, this mingling with
people whom I wouldn't recognize in Wellington, being
herded with the riffraff of the world. They talk of the
lovely maidens. Tell me, Greenbie, have you seen any
here you'd care to mess about with? The tropics!&mdash;rot!"</p>

<p>I saw that I had to deal with a frightfully homesick
man, and there was no point in running counter to him.
The fact that to me the tropics were lovely only when
seen as an objective thing, not as something to feel a part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of, would have made little impression on his mind. He
was condemned to an indefinite sojourn, whereas I was
foot-loose, had come of my own free will, and was going as
soon as I had had enough of it. To him the daily round
of drink and cheap disputes, the longing for his wife
and kiddies, the heat, the mosquitos, the mold, the cheap
beds and unvaried fare, the weeks during which the
British troops had virtually camped on the beach in the
steady downpouring tropical rains; the inability to dream
his way into appreciation of South Sea life; the necessity
of looking upon the natives as possible rebels; suspicions
of the few Germans there, suspicions of every new-comer,
suspicions of even the death-dealing sun,&mdash;no wonder
there was nothing romantic about it to him!</p>

<p>But as we wandered along, chatting in an intimate
way, as only men gone astray from home will chat when
they meet on the highways of the world, he seemed to
grow more cheerful. Time and again he told me what a
relief I was to him, how being able really to talk freely
with me was balm to his troubled spirit. I knew that
an hour after my departure he would forget all about me,
that there was nothing permanent in his regard, that I
really meant nothing to him beyond an immediate release
for his pent-up mind,&mdash;but I felt that he was sincere.</p>

<p>As we kicked our way along the dusty road we came
to a stretch where the palm-trees stood wide apart. The
smooth waters covered the reefs, and a million moonbeams
danced over them. Within the palm groves camp-fires
blazed beneath domes of moon-splattered thatch,
and from all directions deep, clear voices quickened the
night air. We of the Northern lands do not know what
communal life is. We move in throngs, we crowd the
theaters, we crowd the summer resorts,&mdash;but still we do
not know what communal life is. We are separate icicles
compared with the people of the tropics. Only to one
adrift at night within a little South Sea village is the
meaning of human commonalty revealed. It seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
touch Heasley as nothing had done before. After our
little conversation he appeared relieved and receptive.
We wandered about till long after midnight, long after
the village had sung itself to sleep, even then reluctant
to take to our musty beds.</p>

<p>Thus did one day pass in Samoa, and every day is like
the other, and my tale is told.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>I tapped one man after another in Samoa for some
personal recollections of Stevenson, but without success.
At last I heard of an American trader who had been an
intimate friend of R. L. S. and knew more about him
than any other. So to him I went. He was a round-headed,
red-faced, bald individual in the late fifties,
deeply engrossed in the sumptuous accumulations he had
made during more than a quarter-century of residence
in Samoa. His reactions to my declaration of interest
in Stevenson made me think he was turning to lock his
safe and order his guard, but instead he really opened
the safe and dismissed all pretense. In other words, he
realized, it seemed to me, that he had another chance of
adding luster not to Stevenson, but to himself. Stevenson
he dismissed with, "Well, you know, after all he was
just like other men. Often he was disagreeable, ill-tempered,"
etc. The thing worth while was the fact that
<i>he</i> had written a book about Stevenson, in which <i>he</i> had
exhausted all he knew of the man, so why did I not read
that and not bother him about it! I felt apologetic,
almost inclined to bow myself out, backward, when he
announced that he too had written stories of the South
Seas. My interest was whetted. I asked to be shown.
He drew from among his bills and invoices a packet of
manuscripts, and handed one to me to read. I thought of
Setu and his enthusiasm at the recognition at sea of the
light from Vailima, and felt that, as far as Stevenson's
own life went, Setu was, to me at least, more important.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the cynics who laugh at those who
come to Samoa to climb to Stevenson's grave, I was
determined to make the ascent. I could get no one to
make it with me. At five o'clock in the morning I mustered
what energy I had left from the North, ready to
spend it all for the sake of seeing Stevenson's grave.
By six, the wind was already warm and dragged behind
it heavy rain-clouds. Hot and brain-fagged, I pressed
on, my body pushing listlessly forward while my mind
battled with the temptation to turn back. Near the end
of European Apia I turned toward the hills, into a wide
avenue cut through the growths of shaggy palms. Suddenly
opening out from the main street, it as suddenly
closes up, an oblong that dissipates in a narrow, irregular
roadway farther on. It was too overgrown to indicate
any great usefulness, yet in the history of roads, none,
I believe, is more unique. In the days when Samoa was
the scene of cheap international squabbles among England,
France, Germany, and America, Stevenson, the
Scotsman, mindful of the fate of Scotland and of the
similarity between his adopted and his native land, stood
by the natives as against the foreign powers (Germany
in particular). He took up the challenge for Mataafa,
courageously cuddled these children while in prison, and
won their everlasting good-will. Later, as a mark of
gratitude, they decided voluntarily to build a wide road
to Vailima, Stevenson's home. Their ambitions did not
live long. The road was never finished. But this is
indicative not of diminished gratitude, but of the overwhelming
hopelessness of their situation in face of
foreign pressure and native temperature.</p>

<p>For everything in the tropics seems on the verge of
exhaustion, a keen enthusiasm in life which finds its ebb
before it has reached high tide. Only a supreme
endeavor, a will sharper than nature, can overcome the
spirit of non-resistance which condemns native life from
very birth. And it was the remnant of determination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
bred in another climate that carried me on toward the
remains of the object of that gratitude which this road
symbolized.</p>

<p>Vailima was four miles from Apia, hidden within a
rich tropical growth well up the mountain side. Half
the time I rested in the shade, taking my cue from my
idol that it was better to travel than to arrive. No one
was about, except here and there a child in search of
fruit dropped from the tall trees. Presently I came to
a set of wooden buildings on the road which upon investigation
turned out to be the temporary barracks for
the guard of Colonel Logan, commander of the forces of
occupation. The soldiers directed me most cordially to
a path near the barracks, and there a board sign
announced the way to "<span class="smcap">Stevenson's Grave</span>."</p>

<p>Crossing a creek and turning to the right, I found
myself immediately at the foot of Mount Vaea. At this
juncture lay a small concrete pool obviously belonging
to the cottage, well-preserved and clean. So was the
path upward. Strange contrasts here, for both pool and
path were the result of the private interest of the German
Governor of Samoa who, despite Stevenson's bitter
opposition to German possession of the islands, had
generously had the path cleared and widened so that
lovers of the great man might visit his tomb with ease.
It had been neglected for ten years until this German
reclaimed it.</p>

<p>For a decade the grave lay untended. At the moment
of death, the silence is deep. The pain is too fresh. Out
of very love neglect is justifiable, for it is the train of
dejected mourners who cannot think of niceties. But then
come the "knockers at the gate," they who know nothing
of the frailties of men and revel in an immortality that
is memory.</p>

<p>I paused frequently during that half-hour climb. Cooing
doves called to one another understandingly across
the death-like stillness which filled the valley below.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
From the direction of Apia came the sound of the lali,
which seemed only to quicken mystery into being. I
breathed more heavily. There, alone on the slopes of
that peak, with the only thing that makes it memorable
beneath the sod on the summit, I felt strangely in touch
with the dead. The isolation gave distinction to him
who had been laid there, which no monument, however
superb, can give in the crowded graveyard. The personality
of the departed hovers round in the silence.</p>

<p>Still, the thought of death itself is alien here. Fear is
barren. One climbs on with an easy, smiling recognition
of the summit of all things,&mdash;not as death, but as life.
Oh, the sweet silence that muffles all!</p>

<p>A strange relapse into the ordinary came to me as I
reached the top. I took a picture of the tomb, gazed out
across the hazy blue world about,&mdash;and thought of nothing.
I was not disappointed, nor sad. Had I found myself
sinking, dying, I believe that it would not have ruffled
my emotions any more than the flight of a bird leaves
ripples in the air. Below, five miles away, the waves
broke upon the reefs and spread in smooth foam which
reached endlessly toward the shore. "It is better to
travel than to arrive," they seemed to say to me across
the void.</p>

<p>The red hibiscus was in bloom around the tomb. A
sweet-scented yellow flower made the air heavy with its
rich perfume. The trees speckled the simple concrete
casing over the grave with their restless little shadow
leaves. The spot was cool and free from growths. And
it was, then, a symbol of a quarter of a century made real.</p>

<p class="poem">
Glad did I live and gladly die<br />
And I laid me down with a will.<br />
</p>

<p>Savage, child, romancer, literary stylist,&mdash;all have
been under the influence of this wandering Scotsman, and
the manner of showing him love and gratitude has been
not in imitation only. At Monterey in California he was
nursed by an old Frenchman through a long period of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
illness; in semi-savage Samoa men untutored in our
codes of affection beat not a path but a road to his door,
and carried his body up the steep slope of Mount Vaea.
And the month before I stood beside his tomb, the ashes
of his wife and devoted helpmate were deposited beside
him by his stepdaughter, who had journeyed all the way
from California to unite their remains.</p>

<p>Tusitala, the tale-teller, the natives called him, and in
the sheer music of that strange word one senses something
of the regard it was meant to convey. And in the
years to come, when Samoans become a nation in the
Pacific, part of the Polynesian group, Tusitala will doubtless
be one of the heroes, tales of whose beneficence will
light the way for little Polynesians growing to manhood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was becoming too hot up there on the peak for me
before breakfast-time was over, so I slipped down into
the valley. At the barracks the soldiers invited me to
have a bite with them. The simple porridge, the crude
utensils, the bare benches would elsewhere after so long
a walk and so steep a climb have been a Godsend; but
here, in the tropics, it seemed that more would have
been a waste of human life. The sergeant-at-arms asked
me if I should like to have some breadfruit. He stepped
out into the yard and gathered a round, luscious melon-like
fruit which, when cut, opened the doors of alimentary
bliss to me. The trees grow in bisexual pairs, male and
female, the female tree bearing the fruit.</p>

<p>The sergeant then took me to Vailima, Stevenson's
last home, now the residence of the governor-general.
It was, of course, stripped of everything which once was
Stevenson's, and had acquired wings and porticos, gaunt
and disproportioned. I could not work up any sentimental
regret at this change, for that is what Stevenson
himself would have wished. The best way to preserve
a thing is to keep it growing. Stevenson worked here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
for four years; others may tamper with it for four
hundred years without completely obliterating the character
given it by its first maker.</p>

<p>When I entered I was somewhat surprised at the
hangings on the walls. Pictures of the kaiser, pretty
scenes along the Rhine, German castles,&mdash;what had they
to do with Stevenson? what with Colonel Logan and
British occupation? The chambers are so large and the
woodwork is so somber that these pictures fairly shrieked
out at one, like a flock of eagles in high altitudes. I felt
almost guilty, myself, simply for being in the presence
of such enemy decorations, and remarked about them to
my guide.</p>

<p>"The colonel won't touch them," he said, respectfully.
"They are the property of the German Governor, and
till the disposition of the islands is finally settled, the
colonel won't move them. He's a soldier, y'know."</p>

<p>We came out again upon the veranda just in time to
see Colonel and Mrs. Logan arrive in their trap. He
was tall, straight, an icy chill of reserve in his bearing.
Mrs. Logan was a pretty young woman, as warm and
cordial as he was stiff. He preceded her up the steps
and was saluted by the sergeant with the explanation of
my presence.</p>

<p>"Am showing this gentleman round a bit," he said.</p>

<p>"Has he had a look round?" said the colonel, perfunctorily,
saluted stiffly, and passed by as though I
didn't exist. As Mrs. Logan came up behind she suppressed
a smile that threatened to make her face still
more charming, and the two passed within.</p>

<p>I smiled to myself. How should I have been received
had Stevenson come up those steps that day? To the
colonel there was nothing in my journey to the tomb.
Nor was there anything in it to the soldiers at the barracks.
Yet the fact that I had been there made me one
of them.</p>

<p>"How'd ye like it?" asked a soldier on my return,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
with the same manner as though I had gone to see a
cock-fight. "Blaim me if Oi'd climb that yer 'ill on a
day as 'ot as this to see a dead man's grave."</p>

<p>They asked me if I'd like to take a swim in the stream
Stevenson liked so well, and on the strength of my great
interest three of them got leave to accompany me. They
winked to me when the sergeant agreed. We wandered
along, jumping fences, crossing a grassy slope, and
cutting through a spare woods. The bamboo-trees
creaked like rusty hinges. Cocoa plantations stood ripe
for picking. The luscious mango kept high above our
reach, so that we were compelled to devise means of
getting at it. The soldiers seemed concerned about
my seeing everything, tasting everything, learning everything
the place afforded. We chatted sociably, plunging
about in the stream, with only a few stray natives
looking on. Then we made our way back as leisurely
as possible, they being in no hurry to return to the barracks.
How I got back to Apia I haven't the faintest recollection.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>I had set out to see the world without any definite notion
of whither I was drifting. I had bartered the liquid
sunshine of Hawaii for Fiji's humid shade, and twisted a
day in a knot between Suva and Apia so that I hardly
knew whether or not Fiji was more devilishly hot than
Samoa. And then for four days I endured the stench
of ripening bananas in the hold of a resurrected vessel
which, if ships are feminine, as sailors seem to believe,
was decidedly beyond the age of spinsterhood. I was
headed for New Zealand. Little wonder, then, that when
I found that we had finally arrived with our olfactory
senses still sane and were about to land in a real country
with real cities and a social life dangerously near perfection,
I felt as though I were coming to after ether.</p>

<p>When I suddenly found myself alone on the streets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of Auckland, a sense of the icy chill of reserve in civilization
came over me. The weeks in the tropics were of
the past. There, though the faces were more than
strange to me and the speech quite unintelligible, there
was a sense of human kinship which stole from man
to man through the still air. There was the lali thumping
its way across the valley; the chatter of voices by
day, the mutter of voices by night when the people gathered
beneath their thatched roofs; the gradual infusion
of native melody with the swish of palms and the hiss
of the sea; call answering call across the village; songs
with that deep, primitive harmony which effects a ferment
of emotion not in one's heart, but in the pit of the
stomach. In such a place, the word <i>alone</i> has no meaning.
One cannot be a stark outsider. Everything is
done so freely and sociably that even the stranger, despite
thousands of years of restraint in civilization, merges
into an at-one-ment known to no group in our world.</p>

<p>Social life in New Zealand (as in all white communities)
contained no such admixture. Not even on Sunday,
on which day I landed, did the crowds that sauntered
up and down the street, present any kindred closeness.
People just sauntered back and forth across the
three or four business blocks known as Queens Street.
The sweeps and curves and windings which were its
offshoots made a short thoroughfare look picturesque,
but they were just flourishes. They did not lead to anything.
And one immediately returned to Queens Street.</p>

<p>There, the wheeled traffic having been withdrawn, the
people leaving church flooded the wide way, coursing up
and down in what seemed to me an utterly aimless journey
between the monument at the upper fork in the street
and the piers at its foot. As a white man's city goes,
in the three-story structures and spacious business
fronts, and the massing of architecture tapering in an
occasional turret, there was stability enough in the
appearance of things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>There were jolly flirtations, girls singly and in pairs,
some mere children in short skirts, gadding about with
eyes on young men whom they doubtless knew, and of
whom they seemed in eternal pursuit. Groups gathered
for political or religious argument; platitudes and pleasantries
were exchanged, some interesting, some dull, seldom
truly cordial. A vague suspicion one of another
was manifest in every relationship.</p>

<p>Suddenly the crowd vanished. A few persistent ones
hung about the lower extremity of the street or lurked
about the piers, spooning. The street became deserted.
Not a sound from anywhere. No joyous singing under
the eaves, no flickering lamp-lights beneath thatched
roofs. Blinds drawn, doors locked. Sunday evening in
civilization! I had returned.</p>

<small>THE APHELION OF BRITAIN</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>There are no holy places in New Zealand, none of
the worn and curious trappings of forgotten civilizations
to search out and to revere. There are no signposts
which lead the wanderer along, despite himself, in
search of sacred spots; no names which make life worth
while. Whom shall he try to see? Is there a Romain
Rolland or a Shaw, or an Emerson to whom he could
bow in that reverence which invites the soul rather than
bends the knee?</p>

<p>There are only boiling fountains and snow-packed
ranges and wild-waste places to which neither man nor
beast go willingly. Yet an unknown urge pushes one
on, that urge which from time immemorial has impelled
saint in search of salvation, and age in search of youth,
as well as youth in search of adventure, to the most inaccessible
reaches of the world. All of us bring back accounts
of what we've seen, but which of us can answer
why we went?</p>

<p>First impressions in older countries are generally
confusing. Ages of accumulations pile up, covered with
the dust of centuries which has gone through innumerable
processes of sifting. But the stranger in the Antipodes
is plunged into a bath of youth. Every aspect
of the country is young. The volcanoes are mostly
extinct, but about them lurks the warmth of the camp
fire just died down. In mountain, bush, and plain something
of the childhood of Mother Earth is still felt; at
most, an adolescence, rich in possibilities. One almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
feels that the very rivers are only the remnants of the
receding floods after the rising of the land from beneath
the sea. There is nothing old anywhere. Instead of
being disappointed at the apparent paucity of man-made
products, one is greatly surprised that so little and young
a country should have so much. There is room, much
room, ample acres which lie fallow, the winds of opportunity
blowing over them, wild with abandon.</p>

<p>New Zealand, as I said, was a kind of resting-place. It
was the point where the lines of interest in the native peoples
of the Pacific, and those of the efforts of the white
men, intersected, just as later I was to find a point of
intersection between the white men and the Orientals at
Hongkong. For here the new social life of the South
Pacific, and the remnants of the old races of the Pacific
equally divide the attention.</p>

<p>I had some little difficulty locating Auckland from the
steamer, so many suburbs littered the forty miles of irregular
bluff which surrounds the harbor. The homes
upon the hills seemed reserved and unambitious. There
were no streams of smoke from factory and mill. One
felt, at the moment of arrival, that were it morning, noon,
or night, whatever the season, Auckland would still be
the same, and New Zealand would continue to be proud of
the resemblance the youngest of its cities has for its parent.
All seemed quiet, restful and inactive.</p>

<p>If all these were inactive, not so the human elements.
Their rumblings on localisms were to be heard even
before we landed. As a new-comer, I was made aware
of Wellington, the capital, and its winds; of the city of
Christchurch and its plains; of prides and jealousies
which provincial patriots acclaimed in good-natured
playfulness. Dunedin's raininess was said to have been
a special providence for the benefit of the Scotch who
have isolated themselves there. The wonders of this
place and the beauty of that broke through the mists of
my imagination like tiny star-holes through the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>I had returned to civilization, and though all my
instincts settled into an assurance which was comforting,
a feeling that dengue fever was no more, that damp
and moldy beds and smell of copra would not again be
mingled with my food and slumber, still, I knew I was not
a part of it. Almost immediately my mind began moving
spiral-like, outward and upward, to escape. I was
to do it all in a month. I was to see Auckland, with its
neighbor, Mt. Eden, an extinct volcano; I was to visit
the other large cities,&mdash;vaguely their existence was
becoming real to me,&mdash;I was to penetrate at least some
of New Zealand's dangerous bush, to see the primitive-civilized
lives of the native Maories. But, strange to say,
return to civilization had the identical effect on me that
return to primitive life is said to have on the white man.
It entered my being in the form of indolence. I did not
want to move. I wanted to rest. To stay a while in
that place, to make myself part of the life of the city,
to remain fixed, became a burning desire with me. And
days went by without my being able to stir myself on
again.</p>

<p>The life in the Dominion was conducive to ease and
dreaming. Nobody seemed in any hurry about anything,
least of all about taking you in. Every one went upon
a way long worn down by the tread of familiar feet. The
conflicts of pioneer aggressiveness were over. The differences
between the aboriginal and the foreign elements
were lost in the overpowering crowding in of the alien.
The stone and wooden structures, the railways and the
piers, the homes wandering along over the hills as far
as the eye could see, completely concealed that which
originally was New Zealand.</p>

<p>I spent one month wandering up and down Auckland's
one main street, and I can assure you it was like no
other main street in the world, except those of every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
other city in New Zealand. There were the carts and
the cars by day, and the clearing of the pavement of
every vehicle for pedestrian parades by night. There
were the carnivals and the f&ecirc;tes on Queens Street, and
on every other royal highway during the summer months;
and during the two hours which New Zealanders require
for lunch, there was nothing to be done but to lunch too.
And then on Sunday nights there was the confusion of
cults and isms each with its panacea for spiritual and
social ills. Nobody was expected to do anything but go
to church; hence the street cars didn't run during church
hours, and the bathing-places were closed. And after
ten o'clock it was as impossible to get a cup of tea outside
one's own home as it is to get whisky in an open
saloon in New York to-day.</p>

<p>On the <i>Niagara</i> I had been assured by a young lady
from New Zealand that we Americans didn't know what
home life was and that she would show me the genuine
thing when I got to her little country. She did, and I
have been most grateful to her for it. It was sober and
clean and quiet, and I accepted with great satisfaction
every invitation offered me, because it was a thousand
times better than being alone on the deserted streets.
But the good Lord was wise when He made provision for
one Sunday a week, as His human creation could hardly
endure it more frequently; and that is what one might
say of New Zealand home life. It is all that is good
and wholesome, all that is necessary for the rearing of
unobstreperous young, but red blood should not be made
to run like syrup, though I quite agree with my New
Zealand friend that it should not be kept at the boiling-point,
either. Our evenings were usually spent in quiet
chatting on safe generalities interspersed with home
songs and nice cocoa; and at ten o'clock we would separate.
I hope that my New Zealand friends will not feel
hurt at what I say. Let them put it down to my wild-Americanism.
But home life on a Sunday evening was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
not worth going all the way diagonally across the Pacific
to taste.</p>

<p>Hence, a month in Auckland was quite enough for me.
By that time the call of the mountains and lakes had
come to me, and in natural beauty New Zealand can rival
any other country of its size I have ever been to, except
Japan. In answering that call I accepted the swagger's
account of how life should be lived and took to the open
road. In the year that followed I filled my memory
with treasures that cannot be classified in any summary.
From Auckland in the North Island to Dunedin
in the South Island I journeyed on foot through three
long months, zigzagging my way virtually from coast to
coast, dreaming away night after night along the great
Waikato River, holding taut my soul in the face of the
mysteries of the hot-springs districts, and quenching
feverish experiences upon the shores of placid cold lakes
and beneath snow-covered peaks of mountain ranges
thirteen thousand feet high; gripping my reason during
long night tramps in the uninhabited bush (forests)
or in Desolation Gully, forty miles from nowhere. I
know what wild life in New Zealand is, as well as tame.
It is not all that it used to be when men left their home
lands for that new start in life which Heaven knows
every man is entitled to, considering what our notions
of childhood are and the eagerness of man to pounce
upon any one who has not reached insurmountable success.</p>

<p>In between I saw the courageous struggles these selfsame
men have gone through and are still enduring in
order to make of the whole of New Zealand what it is
as yet only in parts. Those parts are rich farm lands,
with swiftly scouting motor-cars used by great capitalist-farmers
who have more than one station to look after.
It is a strange phenomenon of New Zealand life that
the small farm towns are generally much more alert and
progressive than the big cities. The New Zealanders
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
build houses that look like transplanted suburbs from
around New York, and bring to their villages some of
the love of plant life that the city-dweller is soon too
sophisticated to share. They draw out to themselves
the moving-picture theaters, which are now the all-possessing
rage in the Dominion as elsewhere, and read the
latest periodicals with the interest of the townsman.
There are over a thousand newspapers in the Dominion,
which for a population of a million is a goodly number,
though one cannot regard this as too great an indication
of the intellectual advancement of the people. Yet literacy
is the possession of the farmer as much as and
frequently more than the city-dweller in New Zealand.
His children go to school even if they have to use the
trains to get there; free railway passes on these are
accorded by the Government. And on the whole the
farmer's life in New Zealand is richer than that of most
rural communities. But the struggle is still great. I
have seen some who do not feel that the promise is
worth it.</p>

<p>Though each of the big cities in the Dominion has its
own special characteristics, they are all considerably
alike. The three chief ones are all port cities of about
80,000 inhabitants each, and except for the fact that
Dunedin in the far south is essentially Scotch and somewhat
more stolid than the rest, and Wellington in the
center is the capital of the Dominion and therefore suspicious,
one may go up and down their steep hills without
any change in one's social gears. The colonial
atmosphere is at once charming and chilling. There is
a certain sobriety throughout which makes up for lack
of the luxuries of modern life. But one cannot escape
the conviction that regularity is not all that man needs.
Everything moves along at the pace of a river at low
level,&mdash;broad, spacious, serene, but without hidden places
to explore or sparkling peaks of human achievement to
emulate. One paddles down the stream of New Zea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>land
life without the prospect of thrills. One might be
transported from Auckland in the north to Wellington
or Dunedin in the south during sleep, and after waking
set about one's tasks without realizing that a change had
been made.</p>

<p>Every city is well lighted; good trams (trolley-cars)
convey one in all directions, but at an excessively high
fare; the water and sewerage systems are never complained
of; the theaters are good and the shops full of
things from England and America. There are even many
fine motor-cars. But there are few signs of great wealth,
though comparatively big fortunes are not unknown. It
is rumored that ostentation is never indulged in, as the
attitude of the people as a whole is averse to it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, neither are there any signs of
extreme poverty, though it exists; and slums to harbor
it. While the usual evils of social life obtain, the small
community life makes it impossible for them to become
rampant. Every one knows every one else and that
which is taboo, if indulged in, must be carried out with
such extreme secrecy as to make it impossible for any
blemish to appear upon the face of things.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, one is immediately classified
and accepted or rejected, according as one is or is not
acceptable. Having recognized certain outstanding features
of the gentleman in you, the New Zealander is
Briton enough to accept you without further ado. There
is in a sense a certain na&iuml;vet&eacute; in his measurement of the
stranger. He is frank in questioning your position and
your integrity, but shrinks from carrying his suspicions
too far. He will ask you bluntly: "Are you what you
say you are?" "Of course I am," you say. "Then come
along, mate." But he does not take you very far, not
because he is niggardly, but because he is thrifty.</p>

<p>As a result of this New Zealand spirit I found myself
befriended from one end of New Zealand to the other
by a single family, the elder brother having given me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
letters of introduction to every one of his kin,&mdash;in Hamilton,
Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, and
Dunedin. And with but two or three exceptions I have always
found New Zealanders generous and open-hearted.
Wherever I went, once I broke through a certain shyness
and reserve, I found myself part of the group, though
generally I did not remain long, because I felt that new
sensations could not be expected.</p>

<p>My one great difficulty was in keeping from falling in
love with the New Zealand girls. Rosy-cheeked, sturdy,
silently game and rebellious, they know what it is to be
flirtatious. For them there is seldom any other way
out of their loneliness. Only here and there do parents
think it necessary to give their daughters any social life
outside the home. In these days of the movies, New
Zealand girls are breaking away from knitting and home
ties. But even then few girls care to preside at representations
of others' love-affairs without the opportunity
of going home and practising, themselves. Hence the
streets are filled with flirtatious maidens strolling four
abreast, hoping for a chance to break into the couples
and quartets of young men who choose their own manly
society in preference to that of expensive girls. I have
seen these groups pass one another, up and down the
streets, frequent the tea-houses and soda fountains, carry
on their flirtations from separate tables, pay for their
own refreshments or their own theater tickets; but real
commingling of the sexes in public life is not pronounced.</p>

<p>At the beaches! That is different. There the dunes
and bracken are alive with couples all hours of the day
or night during the holiday and summer seasons.
Thence emerge engagements and hasty marriages, nor
can parental watchfulness guard against it.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>The most difficult thing in all my New Zealand experiences
was to reconcile the latent conservatism of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
people with their outstanding progressiveness. It would
be easy to assert without much fear of contradiction that
notwithstanding all the talk of radicalism in the matter
of labor legislation there is little of it in practice in the
Dominion. The reason for this is twofold. First, New
Zealand, unlike Australia and America, was not a rebellious
offshoot of England, not a protest against Old-World
curtailment. Quite the contrary, it was made
in the image of the mother country, and natural selection
for the time being was dormant. Furthermore, it was
simple for labor to dominate in a country where labor
was to be had only at that premium.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the whole Dominion did I come across concrete
evidence of awakened consciousness on the part
of the masses to their opportunities. None of that feverish
haste to raise monuments of achievement to accompany
the legislative enactments which have given New
Zealand an illustrious place among the nations. True,
the country is young; true, there are not enough people
there to pile creation on creation. But that is not it. It
is that they are not keyed up to any great notions of what
they ought to expect of themselves, but are content with
what freedom and leisure of life they possess.</p>

<p>Throughout the length and breadth of the two islands,
islands more than two thirds the size of Japan, there
isn't an outstanding structure of any great architectural
value; there isn't a statue or a monument of artistic importance;
there is hardly a painting of exceptional quality;
nor, with all the remarkable beauty of nature which is
New Zealand's, is there any poetic outpouring of love
of nature that one would expect from a people heirs to
some of the finest poetry in the world. Even British
India has its Kipling and its Tagore. With all the excellence
of their efforts to solve the problem of the welfare
of the masses, New Zealanders show no excessive
largeness of heart in the sort of welcome they extend to
labor of other lands. Here, it would seem, is a land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
where the world may well be reborn, where there is
every opportunity for the correction of age-long wrongs
that have become too much a part of Europe for Europeans
to resent them too heartily. Yet what is New
Zealand doing and what has it done in seventy-five years
to approximate Utopia?</p>

<p>This is not meant as a criticism of New Zealand; rather
is it meant to let New Zealand know that the eyes of the
world are upon it and expect much from it. Possession
may be nine points of the law; but the utilization of opportunity
which possession entails is the tenth point
toward the retention of that which one has.</p>

<p>Babies are cared for better in New Zealand than any
other place in the world, yet boys and girls still receive
that antiquated form of correction, corporal punishment,
and thought of letting the youth find his own salvation,
with guidance only, not coercion, is still alien to the New
Zealand pedagogic mind. Women have had the vote for
over twenty-five years, but the freedom of woman to seek
her own development, to become a factor in the social
life of the community apart from the man's, is still a
neglected dream. And young women are dying of ennui
because they aren't given enough to do. The country
is fairly rich, with its enormous droves of sheep, great
pastures full of cattle, its co&ouml;perative capitalistic farming-schemes;
but the human genius for beauty and self-expression
must find opportunity in Britain or America.
And even the old romance of pioneer life is virtually of
the past. In all my wanderings I came across only one
home that made me throw out my emotional chest to
contain the spirit of the pioneer life of which we all love
to hear. It was a house as rough as it was old, laden
with shelving and hung with guns, horns, and lithographs,
and cheered by a blazing open fire,&mdash;an early
virility New Zealand has now completely outgrown.
The house must have been fifty years old, to judge from
the Scotsman living there. He was keen, alert, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
quick, a most interesting opponent in discussion, most
firm in his beliefs without being offensive. Here, in
the very heart of one of the earliest of New Zealand's
settlement districts in the South Island, he lived with
his family; and something of the old sweetness of life,
the atmosphere of successful conquest, obtained. And
ever as I dug down into New Zealand's past, I found it
charming. The present is too steeped in cheap machine
processes to be either durable or really satisfying.</p>

<p>Discouraging as this may sound, he who has lived in
the little Dominion and has learned to love its people and
their ways, hastens to contradict his own charges. For
in time, as one becomes better acquainted, one finds a
healthy discontent brewing beneath that apathetic exterior.
Just as the Chinese will do anything to "save
face" so the Briton will do anything not to "lose face."
He loses much of his latent charm in so restricting himself,
but when assured that a new convention is afoot
and that it is safe for him to venture forth with it, he
will do so with a zest that is itself worth much.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is in the atmosphere of staid New
Zealand life a passion for the out-of-doors which is worth
more than all the Greenwich Village sentiment twice
over. Girls are always just as happy in the open and
more interesting than when indulging in cigarettes and
exposing shapely legs in intellectual parlors. Given
twenty million people instead of one New Zealand would
blossom forth into one of the loveliest flowers of the
Pacific.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>In the Auckland (New Zealand) Art Gallery hangs
a picture representing the coming of the Maories to
New Zealand. Their long canoe is filled with emaciated
people vividly suggesting the suffering and privation
they must have undergone in coming across the mainland
some four hundred years ago. Venturing with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>out
sail or compass, these daring Polynesians must have
possessed intrepid and courageous natures.</p>

<p>Yet at the time I was in that gallery the place was full
of stifled boyish laughter. A half-dozen little tots, with
spectacles and school-bags, one with blazing red hair,
had come to see the pictures. They were not Maori
children, but the offspring of the white race, which less
than a hundred years ago came in their sailing-vessels
and steamers, with powder and lead, and took with comparative
ease a land won by such daring travail.</p>

<p>I had heard much of these natives,&mdash;idyllic tales of
their charm and the lure of their maidens. Those lovely
Maori girls! I expected to see them crowding the
streets of Auckland. But they were conspicuous by
their absence. Occasionally a few could be seen squatting
on the sidewalks, more strangers to the city than I,
more outstanding from the display of color and manner
which thronged Queens Street than any American could
be in so ultra a British community as dominates New
Zealand. Where are the Maories? I wondered. Upon
their "reservations" like our own Amerinds, or lost to
their own costumes and even to their own blood and color?</p>

<p>I had returned to Auckland from a visit with a friend
whose wife was Maori, in the company of her nephew.
He carried with him a basket of eels as a gift to his
mother, and walked up the street with me. At a corner
he was hailed by a dark-skinned man in a well-cut business
suit, and said, "There is my father. I must leave
you." In another moment he was in a large touring car
and was whizzed away by his Maori father at the wheel.
No wonder I hadn't been able to see any Maories.</p>

<p>I visited a school where Maori boys are being encouraged
to artificial exercises,&mdash;sports, hurdle-jumping,
running. I watched them make ready, eager for the
petty prizes offered. Off went their shoes, out went their
chests, expanded with ancestral joy. In their bare feet,
still as tough as in former days before they were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>duced
to buy cowhides, they skipped over the ground,
filled for the moment with the glory of being alive. Their
faces broke out in fantastic, native grimaces and contortions
as though an imaginary enemy confronted them.
But alas, they were seeking him in the wrong direction!
The enemy comes with no spears, and no clang, but he
is more deadly. He is not without but within. He makes
them cough. They fall behind.</p>

<p>"They do not last long," said the Briton who was instructing
them. "They are dying rapidly of consumption.
As long as we keep them here in school they are
all right. Finer specimens of human physique could not
be found anywhere. But as soon as they return to their
<i>pas</i>, and live in the squalor of the native villages, they
return to all the old methods of life and soon go under."</p>

<p>I set out on my tramp through New Zealand. At
Bombey, a few days' jaunt from Auckland, I met an
old settler, whose accounts of the great and last war of
the redcoats with the fierce fighters of Maoriland dated
back to our own Civil War, 1861-64. Until that time
both Maories and Britons said, with few exceptions,
"Our races cannot mix. One or the other of us must
give away." Naturally, the Maories had the prior
claim, but they finally yielded, surrendering their lands
to the aliens at Ngaruawahia, "The Meeting of the
Waters," that little hamlet lying in the crotch between
the beautiful Waikato River and one of its tributaries.
And henceforward, the two races were constrained to
meet, and rush down together into that green sea of
human commonalty, albeit one of them contributes the
dominant volume.</p>

<p>Maori legend has it that the Maories are the descendants
of the great <i>Rangatira</i> (chief) who was the offspring
of a similarly great <i>Tanewa</i> (shark). He was
born in the dark southern caves of the Tongariro Mountains,
and the spirits of their ancestors have always
dwelt along the broad Waikato. Along this river I wan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>dered
for many days, but I found few of the Rangatira's
descendants. If one is quiet and alone the voice of the
great Tanewa will call softly through the marsh rushes
from out of the heart of the quivering flax. It is peaceful
and encompassing, modest and almost afraid. I
heard it and I am sure those Maories hear it who are
not too engrossed in the scramble after foreign trinkets.
It said: "The last mortal or man descendant of mine will
be the offspring of a Pakeha-Maori (a white man who
lives among the Maories) who will live in the cities and
rush about in motor-cars, but I shall remain in the
marshes, the calm rivers, and near the glittering leaves
of flax."</p>

<p>A few miles farther on I came to Huntley, and hearing
that there was a native village across the Waikato River,
I turned thither by way of the bridge. I overtook two
<i>wahines</i>, slovenly, indolent, careless in their manners.
They spoke to me flippantly. They wanted to know if I
was bound for the missionaries' place. This led to questions
from me: Why were they turning Mormon? Which
sect did they prefer? But I could obtain answers only
by innuendo. I left these two women behind and found
three others chasing a pig in an open field, three boys
bathing a horse in the deep river. All about the village
was strewn refuse; vicious dogs slunk hungrily about,&mdash;neglect,
neglect, on every hand. But instead of flimsy
native huts there were wooden shacks with corrugated
iron roofs, the longer to remain unregenerate, breeders
of disease and wasters of human energy.</p>

<p>But the more elaborate native village at Rotorua, at
the other end of the island, where visitors are frequent,
was more up-to-date and cleaner. And on a little knoll
was a model of an old Maori <i>pah</i>, such as was used in
the days before guns made it possible to fight in ambush
and in the valleys, and brought the sturdy savages down
not only from their more wholesome heights but from
their position of vantage as a race.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Here I met an odd sort of article in the way of human
ware. Only seventeen, he was twice my size, and lazy
and pliable in proportion. He would come into my
room and just stay. With a steady, piercing, yet stolid
and almost epileptic stare, cunning, yet not shrewd, not
steady, nor guided by any evident train of thought, he
would watch me write. I was a mystery to him, and he
frankly doubted the truth of things I told him.</p>

<p>First he said I had the build of a prize-fighter; then,
perhaps on thinking it over, he doubted that I had ever
done any hard work in my life. As to himself, he said
he loved to break in wild horses. His father, according
to one tale, was wealthy; two of his brothers were engineers
on boats. But he hated study. He was altogether
lacking in any notion of time, but he was not lazy. He
was even ready to do work that was not his to do.</p>

<p>One afternoon he was in a most jovial mood. He was
about to have a tent raised in which he would spend the
summer, instead of the hotel room allotted to the help.
He was full of glee at the prospect. Primitive instincts
seemed to waken in him. But there was a sudden reaction,&mdash;whimsical.
We had stepped upon the lawn which
afforded an open view across Lake Rotorua.</p>

<p>"Strange, isn't it," he said without any preamble,
"how money goes from one man to another, from here
to Auckland and to Sydney? So much money." He became
reminiscent: "Maories didn't know a thing about
money. They were rich. See, across this lake,&mdash;that
little island,&mdash;the whole was once a battle-field. The
Maories went out in their canoes and fought with their
battle-axes. What for? Oh, to gain lands. But now
they are poor. Things are so dead here now. Nothing
doing." A moment later he was called and disappeared.
It was the only time he was ever communicative. The
tent had roused in him racial regrets.</p>

<p>One evening he came up to my door and told me there
was a dance at the hall, and that he was going to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Again that strange revival of racial memories, but these
of hope and prospect, came into his face, "I'm going to
take my 'tart' (girl) with me," he announced. And later
in the evening, as I sat alone, watching the moon rise over
the lake, the laughter of those Maories rang out across
the hills.</p>

<p>Though I wandered for many miles, running into the
hundreds, the number of Maori villages and people I
came across were few and far between. Yet records
show that once these regions were alive with more than
a hundred thousand fighting natives. At Rotorua, the
hot-springs district in the North Island, the <i>pah</i> was in
exceptionally good condition, but it was so largely because
the New Zealand Government has made of the
place one of its most attractive tourist resorts and the
natives are permitted to exact a tax from every visitor
who wishes to see the geysers. Elsewhere the villages
are dull, dreary, and neglected: the farther away from
civilization, the worse they get. The consequence is not
surprising.</p>

<p>According to the census of 1896, there were 39,854 people
of the Maori race: 21,673 males, 18,181 females, of
which 3,503 were half-castes who lived as Maories, and
229 Maori women married to Europeans. The Maori
population fell from 41,993 in 1891 to 39,854 in 1896, a
decrease in five years of 2,139. But in 1901 it had risen
to 43,143, going steadily up to 49,844 in 1911, and dropping
to 49,776 in 1916 on account of the European war.</p>

<p>There was considerable discussion in the New Zealand
Parliament on the question of whether the Maories should
be included in the Draft Act, most white men declaring
that a race which was dying, despite this seeming increase,
should not be taxed for its sturdiest young men
in a war that was in truth none of its concern. But the
Maories&mdash;that is, their representatives&mdash;objected, saying
they did not wish to be discriminated against.
Among the young men, however, I found not a few who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
were inclined to reason otherwise. So it was that while
I was talking to the young fellows who were washing
their horse in the Waikato, one of them said to me:</p>

<p>"Yes. Years ago the white men came to us with
guns and cannon and powder and compelled us to give
up our warfare, which kept us in good condition individually
and as a race. We put aside our weapons.
Now they come to us and tell us we must go to Europe
and fight for them." And he became silent and thoughtful.</p>

<p>As I came back into Huntly from my visit to the <i>pah</i> I
passed the little court-house, before which was a crowd
of Maories. Some of the <i>wahines</i> sat with shawls over
their heads smoking their pipes as though they were in
trousers, not skirts. I chatted with the British Bobby
who stood at the door, asking him what was bestirring
Maoriland so much.</p>

<p>"Oh, that bally old king of theirs has been subpoenaed
to answer for his brother. The blighter has been keeping
him out of sight so that he won't be taken in the
draft."</p>

<p>"But," I protested&mdash;democrat though I was, my heart
went out to the old "monarch"&mdash;"can't the king get his
brother, the archduke and possible successor to the
throne, out of performing a task that might hazard the
foundation of the imperial line?"</p>

<p>"King be damned! Wait till we get the blighter in
here," said the servant of the law, pressing his heels
into the soft, oozy tar pavement as he turned scornfully
from me.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>A few days later I was cutting my way through a luxuriant
mountain forest above Te Horoto in the North
Island, listening to the melodious <i>tui</i>, the bell-bird, and
to the song of the parson-bird in his black frock of
feathers with a small tuft of white under his beak, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the reversed collar of a cleric. No sound of bird in any
of the many countries I have been to has ever filled me
with greater rapture than did this. There are thousands
of skylarks in New Zealand, brought from England,
but had Shelley heard the <i>tui</i> he might have written
an ode more beautiful even than that to the "blithe
spirit" he has immortalized. Yet, like the human natives,
these feathery folk have vastly decreased since the
coming of the white man. No wonder Pehi Hetan Turoa,
great chief of a far country on the other side of the
island, in complaining of the decay of his race, said:
"Formerly, when we went into a forest, and stood under
a tree, we could not hear ourselves speak for the noise
of the birds&mdash;every tree was full of them.... Now,
many of the birds have died out."</p>

<p>Enraptured with the loveliness of the native bush and
the clear, sweet air, I pressed up the mountain side with
great strides. Presently I passed a simple Maori habitation.
It was about noon. Seeing smoke rise out of an
opening in the roof, indicating that the owners were at
home, I entered the yard. My eyes, full of the bright,
clear sunlight, could not discern any living thing as I
poked my head in at the door, but I could hear a voice
bidding me enter. I stepped into a sort of antechamber,
a large section of the hut with a floor of beaten earth and
a single pillar slightly off the center supporting the roof.
Gradually, as my eyes became accustomed to the subdued
light, I saw an aged couple within a small alcove on the
farther side. An open fire crackled in the center of its
floor. The old woman sitting on her bed-space, was
bending over the flame, fanning it to life. The old man,
who was very tall, lay on a mat-bed to the right, his
legs stretched in my direction. The two beds, the fire,
and the old couple took up the entire space of the alcove,&mdash;a
sort of kitchenette-bedroom affair like our modern
"studio" apartments.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" asked the old man, after I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
had seated myself before the fire. "America," I said.
My reply evoked no great surprise in him.</p>

<p>"The village is quiet," I said. "Where are the people?"</p>

<p>"Oh, down in the valley, working in the fields."</p>

<p>"Don't you go out, too?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm too old now. My legs ache with rheumatism.
I go no more. Let the young fellows work. Stay
and have tea with us," he urged.</p>

<p>I looked at their stock. They did not seem to have
any too much themselves, and the old woman seemed a
little worried. I knew that the heart of the hostess was
the same the world over, so I assured them I had had
my meal, and only wished to rest a while away from the
sun. The old woman showed relief.</p>

<p>We chatted as cordially as it is possible where tongues
cannot fully make themselves understood. I learned
that the man was an old chief. He could not fall in with
the times, acknowledged his inability to direct the affairs
of this strange world, and only asked for rest and
quiet, and the respect due one of his position. He did
not expect to live long, nor did he much care. "These
are not days for me," he said with a smile. He did not
speak of the former glories of his race. Doubtless he
could not exactly make up his mind whether to look before
or after: if there were great chiefs before, are there
not big M.P.'s now?</p>

<p>The fire was burning low, and I knew that the old
woman would have to go for more wood unless she hurried
with the preparation of her meal, and that as long as
I was there I was delaying her. So I rose to go. The
old man excused himself for not rising by pointing to
his lame legs. She saw me to the gate, and as I struck
down the road she waved her hand after me in farewell,
and remained behind the screen of trees round which I
veered.</p>

<p>Down in the valley lying almost precipitately below<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
me were a number of natives working in their fields; but
my road led me on to the cities, and it is there that the
future of this race hangs in the balance.</p>

<p>Some months later, while I was living in Dunedin in
the far south of the South Island, the newspapers came
out in a way almost American, so exciting was the bit of
news. The editorial world forgot all decorum and dignity
and pulled out the largest type it had on hand. It
was announced that the Maori priest, Rua, was caught.
Several persons were wounded and one, I believe, was
killed in the process. The priest was treated with no
respect and little consideration and thrown into prison,&mdash;all
because he believed in having several wives as his
men-folk always had, if they were chiefs and priests,
and was trying to put a little life into his race, trying
to stir it up to casting out these "foreign devils." He
had built himself a temple that was an interesting work
of art, but it holds worshipers no more, even though the
priest has since been released. His efforts to rouse his
people failed. Such efforts are only the reflex action
of a dying race.</p>

<p>More than a year went by before I began drawing
in the radial thread that held me suspended from
the North Star under the Southern Cross,&mdash;a year
replete with lone wanderings and searching reflections.
During all those months not a single day had passed
without my surveying in my mind's eye the reaches of
the Pacific that lay between me and the Orient. Roundabout
New Zealand I had become familiar with the Tasman
Sea looking toward Australia, on the shores of which
I had spent some of the most mysterious nights of my
life; on Hawkes Bay looking out toward South America;
and across the surging waters of Otago Harbor at Dunedin,
looking in the direction of the frozen reaches of
Antarctica.</p>

<p>Once staid Dunedin was thrilled by a wireless S.O.S.
from the direction of the South Pole. The <i>Aurora</i>,
Shackleton's ship which had gone down to the polar
regions, was calling for help. She had snapped the
cables which tied her to land when the ice-packs gave way
and had drifted out to sea. Fortunately, most of the
officers and crew were at the moment on board, but sixteen
men were left marooned. To add to the prospect of
tragedy, the ice smashed the rudder, and a jury-rudder,
worked by hand from the stern deck, had to be improvised.
With these handicaps the vessel made her way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
slowly till within five hundred miles of New Zealand, the
reach of her wireless. Here she was rescued by a Dunedin
tug and brought to Port Chalmers.</p>

</div>

<p>I made friends with the mate and the chief engineer
and gained access to their superb collection of Emperor
Penguin skins and an unusual number of photographs.
Months afterward they wanted four men to complete the
crew necessary for another journey south and I was
tempted to join them, but tallow and bladder and a
repressed pen were the negatives, while China and Japan
were the positives. So I sailed away with the rising sun
in the direction of the great West that is the Far East.
Crisp and clear in the bright morning air shone the towering
peaks of the New Zealand Alps as I sailed toward
Australia and to Botany Bay,&mdash;not, however, without
being nearly wrecked in the fog which had gathered in
Foveaux Strait, which separates Steward Island from
the South Island in New Zealand. Bluff, the last little
town in New Zealand, is said to have the most southerly
hotel in the world. I saw it.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>Four days from Bluff to Melbourne on a sea that
seemed on the verge of congealing into ice. It was not
cold, yet autumn-like. And the passengers seemed the
fallen leaves. The stewards maintained the reputation
for impudence and unmannerliness of the Union Steamship
Company crews, but I had grown used to that, and
thanked my stars that this was the last coupon in the
ticket I had purchased in Honolulu more than a year before.
Of human incidents there was therefore none to
relate.</p>

<p>But chill and melancholy as that Southern sea was,
there hovered over it a creature whose call upon one's
interest was more than compensating. Swooping with
giant wings in careless ease, the albatross followed us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
day in and day out. Always on the wing, awake or
asleep, in sunshine or in storm, the air his home as the
water is to fish, and earth to mammal. Even the ship
was no lure for him by way of support. He followed it,
accepted whatever was thrown from it, but as for dependence
upon it,&mdash;no such weakness, you may be sure. His
sixteen feet of wing-spread moved like a ship upon the
waves, like a combination of a ship and sails. Swift,
huge, glorious, unconsciously majestic, he is indeed a
bird of good omen. How he floats with never a sign of
effort! How he glides atop the waves, skims them, yet
is never reached by their flame-like leapings; simulates
their motion without the exhaustion into which they sink
incessantly.</p>

<p>The albatross had left us, and now the swarming
is his artistry, so refined his "table manners." He does
not gorge himself as does the sea-gull, nor is he ever
heard to screech that selfish, hungry, insatiable screech.
Silent, sadly voiceless, rhythmic and symbolic without
being restrained by pride of art, he exemplifies right
living. He is our link between shores, the one dream of
reality on an ocean of opiate loveliness wherein there is
little of earth's confusion and pain. For the traveler
he keeps the balance between the deadly stability of land
life and the dream-like mystery of the sea. But for him
it were impossible to come so easily out of an experience
of a long voyage. Away down there he is the only
reminder of reality. Which explains the reverence
sailors have for him and their superstitious dread of
killing him. It is like the dread of the physician that
his knife may too sharply stir the numbed senses of his
patient under an&aelig;sthesia.</p>

<p>Land may be said to begin where the albatross is seen
to depart. He knows, and off he swoops, ship or no ship
to follow and to guide; back over the thousand miles of
watery waste, to measure the infinite with his sixteen-foot
wings, glide by glide, with the speed of a twin-screw tur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>bine.
Only when the female enters the breeding season
does she seek out a lost island to rear her young. Independent
of the sea, these birds are utterly confined to it,
a mystery floating within mystery.</p>

<p>The albatross have left us, and now the swarming
gulls abound. Why they are dignified with the Christian
name "Sea" when they are such homely land-lubbers,
is a question that I cannot answer. Pilots, rather, they
come to see us into the harbor, or, with their harsh
screeching, to frighten us away.</p>

<p>But something within me would not know Australia,
nor any lands, just then. Perhaps it was that my unconscious
self was still with the albatross; for strange as
it may seem I could not sense any forward direction at
all that day, but only one that pointed backward,&mdash;toward
home. Try as I would to realize myself on my way to
Australia, still my mind persisted in pointing toward
America. Not until we got the first sight of land ahead
was my soul set right. Then it was the Sister Islands,
Wilson's Promontory, the Bass Straits, with Tasmania
barely in sight, Cape Liptrap, and finally Port Phillip.
And Australia was on all fours, veiled in blue,&mdash;a thin
rind of earth steeped in summer splendor.</p>

<p>Flag signals were exchanged with the lonely pilot-ship
that hung about the entrance. All being well, we passed
on, crossing that point at the entrance where five strong
water-currents meet and vanquish one another, turning
into a smooth, glassy coat of treachery. The <i>Wimmera</i>
hugged the right shore of the largest harbor I have ever
seen. In places the other shore could not be seen with
the naked eye. But it is very shallow and innumerable
lights float in double file to guard all ships from being
stranded.</p>

<p>Just as we entered, the sun set. A stream of color
unconstrained obliterated all detail as it poured over
the point of the harbor, filling the spacious port. Clots
of amber and orange gathered and were dissipated, sof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>tened,
diffused, till slowly all died down and were gone.
Darkness and the blinking lights of the buoys remained.</p>

<p>Two big ships, brilliantly lighted, flinging their manes
of smoke to the winds, passed, one on its way to Sydney,
the other to Tasmania and Adelaide in the south. Far
in the distance ahead we could see the string of shore
lights at Port Williamson. It took us three hours to
overtake them, and we arrived too late to receive pratique.
For half an hour the captain and the customs
carried on a conversation with blinking lights. The
winches suddenly began their rasping sound, and the
anchor dropped to the bottom. We did not debark that
night.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>I spent nearly six months in Melbourne and Sydney,
those two eastern eyes of that wild old continent, and
for the first time in a twelvemonth the sense of security
from the sea obtained. For a fortnight I occupied a
little shack on Manly Beach, near Sydney, but oh, how
different it was there from the sand-dunes on the shores
at Dunedin, in New Zealand! In the Dominion one had
to hide within the interior to get away from the sea:
on the beach one felt about to slip into Neptune's maw.
But at Manly, Bondi, Botany Bay, the sea might hammer
away for another eternity without putting a landlubber
off his ease.</p>

<p>But we shall return to Australia in another section.
The sea is still much in the blood, there is still a vast
length that lies close to Asia and marks off another line
of our imaginary triangle. Here are no landless reaches,
but all the way to Japan one passes strip after strip, as
though some giant earthquake had shattered part of the
main.</p>

<p>Months afterward I took passage once more, this time
on the <i>Eastern</i>, bound for Japan.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the side of the world I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
on and the direction of my journey from the moment I
stepped upon the pier to which the <i>Eastern</i> was made
fast. Hundreds of Chinese, with thousands of boxes and
bundles, scurried to and fro in an ant-like attention to
little details. Then as the steamer was about to depart,
mobilization for the counting of noses took place, and
veritable regiments of emaciated yellow men lined the
decks. Here and there a fat, successful-looking Chinese
moved round the crowd, an altogether different-looking
species, more as one who lives on them than as one who
lives with them. On the dock stood several groups waiting
to wave farewell to their Oriental kin. One of these
groups was composed of a stout white woman with two
very pretty Eurasian daughters,&mdash;as handsome a pair of
girls as I saw in Australia. Their father was a well-to-do
Chinese merchant taking one of his regular trips to China.
In Australian fashion they were ready for a mild flirtation,
spoke Australian English with Australian slang,
and, aside from their pater, they were native to all intents
and purposes. And in Australia they remained.</p>

<p>Of those who departed, the major number likewise
remained native&mdash;though to China&mdash;despite years and
years of residence in Australia. It is a one-sided argument
to maintain that because of that the Chinese are
unassimilable. There is no ground for such a deduction,
because they arrived mainly after maturity, and the
Chinese could challenge any white man to become one of
them after he has fully acquired his habits and prejudices.
But we had not been many minutes at sea before
it was our misfortune to find that we had among us a
Chinese boy who was born and brought up in New Zealand
and was just then going to China for the first time.
Here I had ample opportunity of observing the assimilability
of the Oriental. And here I bow before the
inevitable.</p>

<p>He had assimilated every obnoxious characteristic of
our civilization, the passion for slang, the impertinence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the false pride, the bluff which is the basis of Western
crowd psychology. He was not a Chinese,&mdash;that he
denied most vehemently,&mdash;he was a New Zealander, and
by virtue of his birth he assumed the right to impose
his boyish larrikinism upon all the ship's unfortunate
passengers. He banged the piano morning, noon, and
night; he affected long, straight black hair, which was
constantly getting in his way and being brushed carefully
back over his head; and he took great pains to make
himself as generally obnoxious as possible. He was not
that serious, struggling Chinese student who comes to
America afire with hope for the regeneration of his race.
He was a New Zealander, knew no other affiliations, had
no aspirations, and lorded it over "those Chinese" who
occupied every bit of available space on the steamer.</p>

<p>In his way he was also a Don Juan, for he hovered over
the young half-Australian wife of a middle-aged Chinese
merchant who was taking her back to China for her confinement.
She was morose, sullen, as unhappy a spirit
as I have seen in an Oriental body. Obviously, China
held few fine prospects for her. She was seldom seen in
her husband's company, for he was generally below playing
fan-tan or gambling in some other fashion. And the
Australian half of her was longing for home. It seemed
to devolve upon our young Don Juan to court this unhappy
creature, and court her he did. But she had no
resilience, no flash, her Chinese half-self offering him as
little reward for his pains as a cow would offer the sun
for a brilliant setting.</p>

<p>I expected any hour of the day to see that woman throw
herself into the sea, or that husband stick a knife into
the bold, bad boy, but nothing happened; the husband
and the wife were seemingly oblivious of the love-making,
and all went well.</p>

<p>Besides the Chinese crew and passengers there were
perhaps a dozen white people, including the officers. An
old English army captain whose passport confirmed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
declaration that he was seventy-three years old, was taking
a little run up to Japan. His only reason was that
Japan was an ally, hence he wanted to see it. Such is
the nature of British provincialism. Otherwise, there
were but two or three young Australians bound for
Townsville, and the stewardess. Somewhere along the
coast we picked up a Russian peasant, who with his wife
had been induced to emigrate to Australia, but who was
now going home to enlist. As though there weren't already
enough men in Russia armed with sticks and stones!
At still another port we commandeered a veritable regiment
of Australian children, colloquially called larrikins.
These were bound for the Philippines, where their father
had preceded them some months before. Their exploits
deserve an exclusive paragraph.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of a clear sky, there would be a shriek
like the howl of a dingo on the Australian plains. There
would be a rush to the defenses by an excited female,&mdash;the
mother. There would follow such a slapping as
would delight the English Corporal Correction League,
except that it wasn't done cold-bloodedly enough. And
thereafter for half an hour there was bedlam all around.
After exhaustion, a new series of pranks set in. This
time they were playing a "back-blocks" game which
entailed a hanging. One of them needs must be hanged,
and was rescued just in time by an ever-swooping mother.
After hours of hunger-stimulating escapades on deck,
the dinner-bell sent them scurrying down into the saloon.
Before any of us had time to be seated all the fruit on
the table was divided according to the best principles of
individual enterprise. Beginning with the first thing on
the menu, they went down the sheet, leaving nothing
untasted; nor did it matter much whether it was breakfast
or dinner,&mdash;steak enough for a meal in itself comprised
the entr&eacute;e. And the littlest kept pace with the
biggest. Nor did afternoon and morning tea escape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
them. Fully stoked up, they were ready for another
beating and another hanging on deck.</p>

<p>In contrast were the little Chinese children,&mdash;quiet,
shy, never spanked; and though they put away enough
within their Oriental bread-baskets, one never saw that
same wild struggle for existence which told the tale of
life on an Australian station better than anything I
wot of.</p>

<p>We had now reached Brisbane, 519 miles from Sydney,
a distance which took the <i>Eastern</i> from noon of the
8th to sunrise of the 10th of October to negotiate. And
from the outer channel to the docks on the Brisbane River
we steamed till half-past one in the afternoon. Here we
were "beached" in the mud when the tide went out and
had to wait twenty-four hours before floating out again.
In the meantime we picked up two more gems,&mdash;mature
larrikin this time. One of them was so drunk he couldn't
see straight, the other was sober enough to bring him
on board. Unfortunately for me, they were placed in
my cabin, and from then on, after the youngsters had
turned the day into chaos, these two would come in to
sleep, and the cursing, the spitting, the reference to
women with which they consoled their souls, would have
shocked the most hardened beach-comber, I am sure.</p>

<p>To avoid annoyances I explored every nook and corner
of the vessel. At last I discovered a sanctuary on the
roof of the unused hospital. It could not be called a
model of order and comfort, for various air-tanks and
stores of sprouting potatoes belittered it. But it was
like the holy of holies to me, for there I might just as
well have been on a lone craft of my own. No sound
reached me from any living thing,&mdash;except an occasional
extra-loud shriek from the youngsters. Above and about
me there was nothing to obstruct my view, and within,
absolute peace.</p>

<p>On the following day we were on the Great Barrier
Reef, grayish green in color, languid in temperament,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
shallow and therefore dangerous in make-up. Numerous
islands, neutral in color and sterile of vegetation, seemed
to stare at us and at one another in mute indifference.
For the first time the storied reality of being stranded on
a desolate island came home to me. As I sat watching
this filmy show, I became conscious of a familiar something
in the world about me, be it warmth or color, a
something which immediately brought the picture of
Santa Anna Valley in California back to mind. Sometimes
we come across a face we feel certain we have seen
before: that was the case with the atmosphere along the
Great Barrier Reef. The setting is that of the island
home of <i>Paul and Virginia</i>. Near and far, lowly and
majestic, in generous succession on each side, were
islands and continent,&mdash;an avenue wide, spacious, and
clear. Occasional peaks along the mainland recalled old-fashioned
etchings,&mdash;dense clouds, heaven-reaching
streaks and shafts of twice-blended astral blue; rain-driven
mountain fiords.</p>

<p>Early one day, an hour before dawn, the <i>Eastern</i>
moored before Magneta Isle with her stern toward
Townsville, as though ready for instant flight, if necessary.
With an early-morning shower of filthy words,
one of my cabin-mates pulled himself together and
dressed. Shortly afterward he slipped over the side
of the ship into a tossing and pitching launch and was
rushed to Townsville. His rousing me at that hour was
the only thing I had reason to be grateful to him for in
our short acquaintance.</p>

<p>For the world was exquisitely beautiful in its delicate
gown of night. Dawn was but waking. Four-o'clock
stupor superintended the easy activities. A few lights
in a corner, a bolder and more purposeful flash from a
search-light, and all set in twilight. A ring of islands&mdash;the
Palm Isles&mdash;stones set in a placid bay. That was
all I saw of Townsville.</p>

<p>And perhaps it is just as well. It may have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
"ordained" that my ignorance obtain, be the city's virtues
and its right to fame what they may. What if I had
gathered closer impressions, added meaningless statistics
or announced the prevalence of diphtheria throughout
Queensland, or discovered the leading citizen of
Townsville to an apathetic world? But it may be of
interest to hear that Townsville claims one distinction.
It is the Episcopal See of Australia and the seat of the
Anglican Bishop and possesses a cathedral.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>On the afternoon of the following day a heavy wind
or squall came up. This time the ship did not defy it.
No foolhardy resistance here. The reefs are too near
and they stretch for thirty miles seaward. Again we
anchored. The horizon contracted like a noose of mist;
it stifled one. The ship seemed to crouch beneath the
winds. An hour, and the anchor was heard being lifted
and the propellers were slowly revived to action. A
little later we anchored again. A light was hoisted to
the stern mast and twilight lowered on a calm gray sea.
Distant little flat islands loomed through the mist. Two
sailing-vessels at anchor, moored in companionship,
rested within an inlet. A gentle swish, a murmur of
human voices, and our little world was swaying gently
upon a curious world. And there we remained all night.</p>

<p>As the sun gave notice of day, we moved off, and all
day the sea was so still that but for the vibration of the
screws it would have been hard to realize that the ship
was in motion. Here we came to where the jagged coastline
has run down. Tiny islets, flat and low, most of
them but a landing-place for a few tropical trees. Summer
calm, with barely a ripple of the sea. That night
we anchored again, having come, it was said, to the most
dangerous pass on the reefs.</p>

<p>Ten days after having left Sydney we arrived at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
last port in Australia, Thursday Island. A cloudy
morning had turned clear for us, but on ahead to the
northwest hung heavy mists. Because of these, I was
later told by two soldiers on guard atop the mountain
fortification, they could not see us coming. They saw
our smoke, but the steamer was hidden from them by
mist. Then suddenly we shot into view. All the while
we had been in the clearest sunshine, the sea glassy and
the flying-fish darting about. It was no place for speed.
We moved just fast enough to leave the scene undisturbed.
And thus we stole into Torres Straits.</p>

<p>Of all the numerous harbors I have entered in the
Pacific, none, with the exception of the Inland Sea in
Japan, is more picturesque than that at Thursday Island.
Shelter, space, and depth, and stillness! One's eyes
sweep round this pearly promise with greed for its
beauty. Seventy-five sail-boats, their sailless masts
swaying with the swells, are anchored on the reefs. It
is Sunday and they are at rest, but what enchantment lies
hid in those folded sails! I wish for the power to utter
some word which could put them to flight; but that
remains for Monday, when "the word" is spoken.</p>

<p>And on Monday, too, immediately upon leaving port
at ten o'clock, the ship's time was returned to standard
time, leaving Australia and its "bunkum" daylight-saving
time behind. Thence we lived again by "dinkum"
time. The ship about-faced and left the channel the
same way it had entered, and shortly afterward we struck
across the Arafua Sea.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>From that day until I reached Japan it was all I could
do to keep track of the seas we passed through,&mdash;Arafua,
Banda, Molucca, Celebes, Sulu, China, and the Inland
Sea.</p>

<p>As we neared the equator again, there was nothing to
disturb the peaceful splendor of life, except the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
hoodlums on board. About sixty miles south of it a
tiny creature, like a turtle, sailed along the still surface;
the flying-fish blistered the water, the scars broadened
and healed again just as the sportive amphibians pierced
it and disappeared. What a contrast to the albatross!</p>

<p>Then the miracle occurred. From the west, hidden
from me by the ship, the sun reached to the eastern
clouds, dashing them with pink and bronze and blue.
I could not tell where the horizon went to, and was roused
to curiosity as to what kind of sunset could effect such
lovely tints. It wasn't a sunset, but a sunfall, a revelation.
Where suggestion through imitation glistened on
the eastern side, daring prodigality of color swept away
emotion on the western side. It was neither saddening
nor joyous. It was a vision of a consciousness in nature
as full of character, as definitely meaningful and emotional
as a human face. There was something almost
terrifying in the expression of that sunset face. One
could read into it what one felt in one's own soul. And
a little later a crescent moon peeped over the horizon.</p>

<p>At about midnight of the seventeenth day after leaving
Sydney we crawled over the equator, and no home-coming
ever meant more to me than seeing the dipper
again and the Northern stars. During all those days
nothing wildly exciting had happened at sea; but just
after we left the equator we passed a series of water-spouts&mdash;six
in all&mdash;which formed a semi-circle east, south,
and west. The spout to the east seemed to me to be at
least two or three hundred feet high, and tremendous
in circumference. It drew a solid column of water from
the sea far into a heavy black cloud. On the sea beneath
it rose a flutter of water fully fifty feet high, black as
the smoke produced by a magician's wand. Weird and
illusive, the giants beggared description as they stalked
away to the southeast, like animated sky-scrapers.</p>

<p>Then we reached Zamboanga, the little town on the
island of Mindanao of the Philippines. From there, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
twelve hours, we crept long the coast till we entered
Manila Harbor.</p>

<p>There remained but two days' voyage before I would
reach Asia, the object of my interest for years, and of
all my efforts for two. But it was not so easy as all
that, for two days upon the China Sea are worth a year
upon the Atlantic. Riding a cyclone would be riding a
hobby-horse or a camel compared with the Yellow Sea,
and though I was the only passenger who missed only
one meal during the whole period, I was beaten by the
seventy-three-year-old English captain,&mdash;who managed
all but half a meal. The sea would roll skyward as
though it were striving to stand on end and for a moment
the ship would lurch downward as though on a loop-the-loop.
Sometimes it seemed as though the world were
turning completely over. Yet I was told this was only
normal, and that typhoons visit it with stated regularity.
The China Sea is "the very metropolis of typhoons."</p>

<p>A month had well-nigh gone before we reached Hong-Kong,
the British portal to Cathay, a month of dreamy
weather. Only one thing more,&mdash;a thing more like a
scene in the Arabian Nights. Toward the end of the
journey I discovered where the five hundred Chinese
whose noses had been counted when we left Sydney had
gone. Going forward, I looked over into an open hatchway,
down into the hold, and there was a sight I shall
never forget. These hundreds of deck passengers were
all in a muddle amid cargo, parcels, hundreds of birds in
cages, parrots, a kangaroo,&mdash;yet oblivious of everything.
For the entire voyage nothing that I tell of could possibly
have come within their ken, as during those days
their minds were bent on one thing and one alone,&mdash;on
playing fan-tan. There in the bottom of the hold hundreds
of gold sovereigns passed from hand to hand in a
game of chance. And at last they were to be released,
to spread, a handful of sand thrown back upon the beach.</p>

<p>As for myself, with my arrival at Hong-Kong and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
visit to Shanghai ended the longest continuous voyage I
had made upon the Pacific, and the second side of that
great Pacific Triangle was drawn. But meanwhile let me
review in detail the outposts of the white man in the far
Pacific&mdash;the lands I had passed on the white man's side
of the triangle, ending in Hong-Kong, where white man
and Oriental meet.</p>

<small>THE AUSTRALIAN OUTLANDS</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>In the normal course of human variation, there should
have been virtually no change of experience for me in
going from New Zealand to Australia, notwithstanding
the twelve hundred miles of sea that separate them.
And though the sea is hardly responsible, there was a
difference between these two offshoots of the "same"
race for which distance offers little explanation. To me
it seemed that regardless of the pride of race which
encourages people to vaunt their homogeneity, the way
these two counterparts of Britain have developed proves
that homogeneity exists in wish more than in fact. It
seems to me that the New Zealander has developed as
though he were more closely related to the insular Anglo-Saxon,
and the Australian as though he were the continental
strain in the Englishman cropping out in a new
and vast continent. However, this is sheer conjecture.
All I can do is to offer in the form of my own observations
reasons for the faith that is in me.</p>

<p>From the moment that I set foot in Australia I felt
once again on a continent. Melbourne is low, flat, and
gave me the impression of roominess which New Zealand
cities never gave. They, with the exception of Christchurch
on the Canterbury plains, always clambered up
bare brown hills and hardly kept from slipping down
into the sea. But in Australia I felt certain that if I set
out in any direction except east I could walk until my
hair grew gray without ever coming across a mountain.
It was a great satisfaction to me that first day, for it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
was intensely hot and I had a heavy coat on my arm
and two cameras and no helmet. Added to my difficulties
was the cordiality of an Australian fellow-passenger
who was determined that I should share with him his
delight at home-coming. He was a short, stout, olive-skinned
young man of about twenty-three who had a
slightly German swing in his gait and accentuated his
every statement with a diagonal cut outward of his right
hand, palm down.</p>

<p>He lured me from one end of Melbourne to the other,
made me lunch with him at a vegetarian restaurant,&mdash;which
is a very popular resort in Melbourne,&mdash;introduced
me to Cole's Book Arcade, to the Blue-bird Tea
Rooms, where fine orchestral music flavors one's refreshments,
to the latest bank building and even to the station
of the railway, which "carries the largest suburban passenger
traffic of any in the world." "Meet me under
the clock," is the Melbournian motto. How they can all
do so is beyond me, for the half-dozen stone steps that
lead to the narrow doors at the corner of the station
could not, I am sure, afford a rendezvous for more than
thirty people at one time; yet the old clock ticks away
in patience,&mdash;the most popular and most persistent thing
in Melbourne.</p>

<p>I had so much trouble keeping pace with this Australian,
who seemed to grow more energetic the hotter it
became, that I was grateful when he said he would have
to leave me, and I was alone again. Then I realized
for the first time that I could really like Melbourne; that
it had long, broad, spacious streets with clean, fresh-looking
office and department-store buildings, that even
the narrower side streets were clean and inviting, and
that the street cars were propelled by cables and not by
trolley wires. So easy were these cars and so low that
no one ever waited for them to stop, but hopped aboard
anywhere along the street. Melbourne was to me a
perfect bath in cleanliness and orderliness,&mdash;just what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
a city ought to be. Even in the very heart of the city
the homes had a suburban gentility about them, and
there were no unnecessary noises, no smoke, and no end
of pretty girls. The people were a joy to look at.
Something of the tropical looseness in both dress and
flesh, as though their skins were always being fully ventilated,
made them attractive. The New Zealanders
made me feel as though I were in a bushel of apples;
the Australians, carefully packed yellow plums. I have
never enjoyed just being on the street more than I did
in Melbourne.</p>

</div>

<p>On Bourke Street, in the very midst of the pushing
crowd, a soft-voiced lad approached me for some information
and strutted off, tall in his self-confidence. Victorian
belles, tall, graceful, russet-skinned, plump but
not flabby, moved with a fine air of self-reliance. On
closer acquaintance, I found that these girls were not
silent and opinionless as were most of the New Zealand
girls. Whatever the issue before the public, they had
their defined opinions concerning it, and they were not
sneered at by the men. Then, too, there was a companionship
between the boys and girls, without reserve,
that was balm to my soul after the year in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Melbourne was the home of Madame Melba, and in
consequence the city is the most musical of any I lived in
in the Antipodes. Even the babies sing operatically on
the streets, and the voices one hears from open windows
are not the head-voices of prayer-meetings, but those of
people who seem to know the value of the human larynx.</p>

<p>During the two weeks that I was in Melbourne, I was,
whenever I chose, a guest of the Master of the Mint,
Mr. Bagg, who was the uncle of a New Zealand girl of
my acquaintance; lunched, dined and afternoon tea-ed
with his family whenever I felt like it; was rushed to the
theater to see an old pioneer play; and went to attend
public meetings at which the mayor and the prime minister
spoke; visited the beaches, and knew the joy of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
most refreshing companionship it was my good-fortune
to meet with in all my wanderings,&mdash;though there were
others. And it was so with whomever I met in Melbourne,
from the clerk in the haberdashery, who acquainted me
with the jealousy that exists between Sydney and Melbourne,
to the woman in whose home I roomed on Fitzroy
Park, or the young couple with the toddling baby and the
glorious sheep-dog, who engaged me in conversation on
the lawn near the beach at St. Kilda.</p>

<p>And so I still see Melbourne in memory as a place I
should enjoy living in. I was often alone, but never
lonely in it. And I see it from its Botanic Gardens, with
the broad Yarra Yarra River slowly cleaving it in two,
its soft, semi-tropical mists hanging over it, its temperate
climate, its cleanliness and its low, rolling hills where
it hides its suburbs.</p>

<p>I didn't go to see Adelaide, in South Australia, because
I was destined to live in Sydney, in New South Wales.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>It is more than mere accident that Victoria has
broader-gaged railways than New South Wales, and that
travelers from one state to the other must get off at
Albury and change, or between New South Wales and
Queensland to the north of it. It is not mere accident,
I am sure, for there is a like difference in the width of
streets between Melbourne and Sydney.</p>

<p>Sydney is hilly, exposed, bricky, and crowded, and
though it is the premier city of Australia, it grows without
changing. There is a conservatism about it which,
in view of the activity of Australians, is inexplicable.
Sydney is almost an old city. Its streets wind as though
the settlers had been uncertain of the prevailing winds;
and the hills tend to give it an appearance of huddling.
The red roofs of the cottage-like houses, and their architectural
style give it a European tone, slightly like an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
English city. It has none of the fresh, "hand-me-down"
regularity of the American, nor the sober coziness of the
English, village. Every street leads one to the center of
the city, and wind as it will there is hardly any relief
from commonplaceness. The thoroughfares are crowded
with street cars which cross and circumambulate, some
of the main streets are too narrow for more than single-track
lines. Yet instead of seeing the earlier error and
trying to correct it by prohibiting the erection of buildings
on the present curb lines, the authorities have permitted
one of the finest office buildings in the city&mdash;the
Commonwealth Bank Building, to be placed on the same
line as the rest of the old structures. It is hardly to be
expected that such methods will ever broaden the streets.</p>

<p>There are no tenements in Sydney, in the New York
sense of the term, but the average home as I saw it on my
usual rounds in search of quarters, was ordinary. The
rooms were small, and there were few conveniences.</p>

<p>But this is Sydney proper. Newer Sydney, with its
suburbs and homes along the numerous peninsulas projecting
into the waters of Port Jackson, is modern, clean,
and airy, and really convenient. Man is a lazy animal
and prone to dote on nature's beauties, neglecting his
responsibilities to nature. Sydney, proud of its harbor,
builds there and forgets its city-self. There are no fine
structures to speak of, no monuments, no art, and even
the library has to borrow a roof for itself in a building
essentially excellent but neglected as a municipal white
elephant. But there is a municipal organ in the Town
Hall, and that makes up for much that is wanting in
Sydney.</p>

<p>I took up my quarters across the water from Sydney,
and from there I could see the city through the glory-lens,
its harbor. Little peninsulas, crossed in but a few
minutes, project into the waters of the harbor, making
it look like an oak-leaf and affording sites for the splendid
homes that have been built there. Crowding is im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>possible;
views of the water may be had from all angles.
And here, in a borrowed nest, I sat for hours perched
above the water, noting and gloating over its moods and
character. What charm it works, when in the blood-red
streaks of sunset the tidal floods cool the peaceful turquoise;
when the busy little ferries of day become fairy
transports with streaks of shimmering light as escort,
moving across the still waters; when on Sunday morning
Sydney across the way relaxes, amazing with revelations.
With street and sky-line clear, quiet hangs in the air;
or on more windy days, myriad whitecaps royne at the
numerous ships which cross and recross one another's
paths. In one direction, industry is idealized; in others,
nature and beauty lie naked, above idealization.</p>

<p>For two weeks I lived out at Manly Beach, nine miles
by ferry from Sydney, and went in and out every day.
The Heads lie to the right, and as we made our way
across, the swells from the sea beyond rolled the little
ferry teasingly. At times, when the swells were heavier
and the crowds excessive, a sort of panic would spread
over them, but some of the inevitable minstrels that
swarm the streets and by-ways of Sydney, would counteract
contagion with music and song.</p>

<p>The beaches are always crowded. Annette Kellerman
is Australian, and somehow, whether as cause or effect,
Sydney people are the most amphibious folk in the world.
They seem to live in the water. Every spare hour is
spent on the wide stretches of sand that lie warm and
white in the blazing sun. But nothing takes precedence
over the harbor in the adoration of Sydneyites.</p>

<p>Sydney is known for its gaiety, yet I was lonely in
Sydney,&mdash;bitterly so. Perhaps people are too gay to
think of others, perhaps their gaiety made me exaggerate
my loneliness. "Nothing like the Australian larrikin
when he gets going," you will be told. But what struck
me was the latent distemper that lurked beneath much
of the hilarity that I saw in Sydney. Australia is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
very different from any of us,&mdash;a little more imitative,
a little more outspoken, a little more gruff, a little more
youthful. But wildness is not specially Australian; nor
is bluntness; nor yet youthfulness. The Australian is
perhaps a little more reckless, individually or <i>en masse</i>,
than the people of other lands, but he puts up with the
same social inconveniences; he reasons falsely at times
and gets fooled; he gloats over the spectacular, becomes
intensely excited over nothing,&mdash;and suddenly relapses.
In a crowd he sometimes becomes belligerent, yet is
easily led and easily relinquishes. But, above all else,
he is gregarious. And it is because of this that he takes
you in in Sydney,&mdash;and drops you out before you have
known what has happened to you. Hence he is an inveterate
sportsman, a heavy drinker, a perpetual gambler
at the races,&mdash;faithful to his whimsicalities.</p>

<p>Intellectually he is a fanatic, but tolerates all sorts of
fanaticisms. A Sunday morning on the beautiful
grounds of the Public Domain is enough to convince you
that Sydney would welcome the most freakish freak in
the world, imprison him for the fun of it, then sympathize
with him if he dies in prison, as did the famous naked
man, Chidley. I have seen Sydney men who seemed to
me men without hearts, as soft and gentle as women in
the face of another man's hurt. Yet when a well-known
army officer stole funds that belonged to wounded soldiers
and their needy families, I heard respectable Sydney
men say they were glad he got away with it. I have
seen girls at carnivals, who at ten o'clock went about
tickling strange men under the chin, snarl at them at
eleven and order them to "Trot along, now." I have
heard Australians say harsh things of themselves in
criticism, but true loyalty is widely prevalent among
Australians. An Australian always wants a mate,
"some one who would stick like lead" if he were up
against it. The self-criticism comes rather from the
more thoughtful Australians, who, looking out upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
future, want to see their country hold on to the prize it
has won, and grow and become a leader in the affairs
of the Pacific.</p>

<p>But though Sydney and Melbourne are the leading
cities of the commonwealth, he who has to judge of the
nation by them wonders where that leadership is to come
from. The love of pleasure is a sign of health in any
people; and Australia is in that sense most healthful.
Material progress is the next best indication of the state
of a nation; and Australia is universally prosperous. But
it is in the outlook on life that a country justifies its existence
and insures itself against decay. Until the war,
all reports of Australia on that score were negative.
Provincialism, of the most ingrowing kind, obtained.
Every state thought chiefly of itself; every city of itself
only; every district of none other than itself. But with
the war Australia took a tremendous leap forward. For
the first time in her history, her men had a chance to
leave the land which intellectually was little more than
a sublimated prison to them. Half a million men left
Australia for Europe and other sections of the globe.
And if Australia knew what she was about she would now
send the rest of her men and women abroad with the same
end in view,&mdash;the education of the people for the place
they occupy in the world.</p>

<p>Much criticism is flung at Australia because her young
men and women are inclined to enjoy life rather than
burden themselves with a succeeding generation. If the
beginning and end of life is reproduction, then that is a
just criticism. But the welfare of the living is as important
as the welfare of civilization. The greatest
criticism is not that people will not bear children in the
face of trying economic conditions, but that, having exceptionally
favorable circumstances, they show no special
inclination to become parents, and that nothing is being
done to create conditions under which the bearing of
young would be no handicap. But that requires an intel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>lectual
outlook which is at present wanting in the cities
of Melbourne and Sydney. There is an over-emphasis
of pleasure <i>per se</i>, a lack of seriousness in the concerns
of life.</p>

<p>Sydney lures men and women from the back-blocks
and makes them feel human again, makes them forget
the plains are sear, and that manliness is next to cleanliness.
It affords dull station-owners a chance to mix
with folk where sweetness and refinement, and not crudeness,
is the order of the day and of life. It takes men
and women who have been told that to increase and multiply
is the only contribution they can make to the welfare
of the community and shows them that there is
something in life besides that. So when I think of what
Sydney means to the world that lies behind it I cannot
refrain from offering my contribution of praise. But
then I ask myself and Sydney what it has done to make
the back-blocks better, what it is doing to build up the
country, and the fact becomes evident that it is only
draining it. Fully 51 per cent of the inhabitants of Australia
live in cities. It is for these cities to lay railroads
and highways and to open the vast continent; and that
can be done only by putting prejudices aside, by adding
to recreation real creation and a soberness in the affairs
of life which alone will win for Australia its place in
the affairs of the Pacific.</p>

<p>What, socially and individually, then, is the contribution
of Australia to the civilization of the Pacific? Is
her position to be one of eminent leadership commensurate
with the welfare of the individual members of the
Commonwealth, or is their joyousness going to make her
citizens forget ambition and their ruling destiny? This
much must not be forgotten,&mdash;that born as a convict
colony, Australia has more than justified itself; that the
term "convict colony" is now no more applicable to
Australia than it is to Virginia. That handicap notwithstanding,
Australia to-day is as far advanced as any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
nation in the world. The people do not generally take
to higher mathematics, to philosophical thinking, or to
science, but illiteracy is rare in Australia. Given a continent
wherein nothing of civilization was to be found,
Australia has made of it, in a little more than a century,
a land productive, healthful, and promising. Much
praise is due Japan for what she has accomplished along
material lines in seventy years; how much more praise
is due Australia for what she has done in about the same
time!</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>As one journeys north along the Australian coast, life
begins to thin out. Fate must have been in a comic
mood when it apportioned me my experiences as I was
leaving that island continent, for in Brisbane it allotted
me an august funeral, and in Thursday Island it sent a
missionary out to "attack me." Thereby hang two
tales.</p>

<p>I had walked what seemed to me fully two miles from
the pier in the Brisbane River to the heart of town
and was rather overheated. My septuagenarian Englishman
trudged along by my side. When we arrived in
the central thoroughfare I took note of the fact that
things looked fresh and clean, that there was a tendency
toward pink paint, but that otherwise I might have saved
myself the journey. Alas, it was Saturday afternoon,
and a half-holiday! Leaving my venerable comrade behind,
I strode along at my own pace in search of adventure,
my camera across my shoulder. I had taken to a
hilly side street, and must have looked like a professional
tourist. Absorbed in seeking, I was startled by an appealing
voice behind me. Turning, I found the owner of
that voice gazing intently at my camera.</p>

<p>"That's a camera you have there, sir."</p>

<p>I admitted my guilt, wondering what crime lurked in
the possession of a camera.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've been trotting all over town trying to find a photographer,
sir, but their shops are all closed. Would you
mind coming along with me, sir, and taking a picture of
a funeral as the mourners come out of church. Lady
---- is so anxious to have a picture of them just leaving
church. The deceased, sir, her husband, was a very
much beloved gentleman, a prominent official, and devoted
to the church in which now lie his remains, and she
would be so pleased if you would come and taik a fouto
for her." In his excitement, he slipped into the use of
cockney, so prevalent in Australia. I threw out my chest
and thought to myself: "See here, old man, do you think
I've lived in New York and London and Paris, and
Sydney, and &mdash;&mdash; to be sold a gold brick in Brisbane?
But I'll show you I'm game." And I followed him up
the street. But sure enough, there at the top of the hill,
from an imposing church, emerged a funeral, posing
to be taken. It did not matter to this man that I told
him my ship was in port only for the day and that before
I could possibly make a print I should be either in China
or Japan. But just then Fate thought she was carrying
the joke too far and sent along a native son with a
camera, and I was released. I set out for the ship.</p>

<p>In the little gullies that lie along the way were shacks
or cottages, raised on piles, with inverted pans between
them and the floor beams. White ants were eating to
pulp these supports. We were in the tropics again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fate must have chuckled. She is fond of practical
jokes. The next time she tried one on me, I was in
Cairns. Having entered Australia on the ground floor,
Melbourne, I suppose Cairns might be said to be the
fifth-story window. I left the ship the moment she was
made fast, keyed up with expectation of seeing the tropics
again. Ashore, the spirit hovering about tropical villages
took me in hand. No better guide can be found
on earth. With a voice subdued, it urged me to pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
quickly through the town, which was still asleep except
for the saloons and their keepers. The spirit leading me
complained of that other spirit which leads and captures
most men in the tropics. My spirit, happy to have a
patron, offered me luxurious scenes, melodious sounds,
and mellow colors,&mdash;happy in receiving a grateful
stranger. While pressing through the little village, I
noticed the mission type of architecture of the post-office;
the concrete columns guarding the entrance of the newspaper
office; the arched balconies of a hotel; the delicate,
dainty cottages raised on wooden piles, the verdure hiding
defects, and the main building lost in a massive
growth of yellow flowers overgrowing roof and all. A
small opening for entrance and a pugnacious corner were
the only indications of its nature as a residence. Then
there were a "School of Arts" and a double-winged
girls' school. The whole town was pretty and in concord
with the scenes about.</p>

<p>But I was not held. I pressed on toward the hills,
to the open road. <i>Allons!</i> But alas! I betrayed myself
by doubting the "spirit of the tropics" which was guiding
me. I resorted to a tiny mortal for information,
and in that way angered the spirit, which instantly deserted
me. Not content with whisperings, I had sought
definition, asked for distance,&mdash;Where? Whence? How?
And I lost!</p>

<p>He was a little man, with worn shoes from the holes
of which peeped stockingless feet. In the early morning
he had slipped on shoes which would not deprive
him of the dew. He had covered his little legs with a
dark pair of dirty trousers, his body with a soiled white
coat, and his mind with misunderstood scripture. His
bulging eyes betrayed his inward confusion.</p>

<p>Upon inquiring, he informed me that the road led to
the hospital and would take me fifteen minutes to negotiate.
Then he wanted to know if I came off the <i>Eastern</i>.
"Any missionaries on board?" he asked. "I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
know," I answered. "I suppose that is something you
don't trouble much about." I agreed. "Ah, that's just
it. Don't you know the Bible says, 'Be prepared to meet
thy Maker?' How do you know but what any moment
you may be called?" "Well, if I am, I have lived well
enough to have no fear." "Yes, that is just it. You
live in carnal sin. You have no doubt looked upon some
woman with lustful eyes this very morning. I sin, too,
every moment." Heaven knows I had not been tempted.
I hadn't seen any woman to look at, and nothing was
further from my mind just then. And so it was,&mdash;sin,
assumption and condemnation. I talked with him a few
minutes, asserted my fearlessness, the consciousness of
a reasonably good life. But nothing would do. The
poison of fear with which he contrived to wound me I
now had to fight off. I had come out all joy and happiness
in the new day, the loveliness of life. If worship
was not on my lips it was in my heart, and he had tarnished
it. He brought thoughts of sin and death to my
mind, which, at that moment, if at any time in my life,
was free from selfishness and from unworthy desires.</p>

<p>I cut across to the sea,&mdash;not even an open avenue
being fresh enough for me now. It was as though I had
suddenly inhaled two lungfuls of poison gas and
struggled for pure air. I turned back to the boat, not
caring to go too far lest she leave port. A tropical
shower poured its warm water over me as though the
spirit of the tropics felt sorry, and forgave me. I returned
to the ship, and quarter of an hour later we were
moving out into the open sea again.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>The next and last time that I landed on Australian soil
was at Thursday Island, one of the smallest of the Prince
of Wales group, north of Cape York Peninsula, in the
Torres Strait. German New Guinea (now a British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
mandatory) lies not far away. There is not much of a
village and most of the buildings are made of corrugated
iron. But there was not at that time that stuffy,
damp odor which pervades Suva; nor, in fact, was there
much of that mugginess that is Fiji. Yet it is only
eleven degrees from the equator, whereas Fiji is thirteen.
The street is only a country road, and dozens of
goats and kids pasture upon it. The few stores (closed
on Sunday) were not overstocked. There are two large
churches. One was built from the wreckage of a ship
that had some romantic story about it which I cannot recall.
There was also another institution, the purpose of
which I could not discern. It was musty, dirty, dilapidated,
with shaky chairs and shelves of worm-eaten books.
I suppose it was a library. Hotels there were galore, and
though bars were supposed to be closed on Sunday, a
small party of passengers succeeded in striking a
"spring."</p>

<p>I wandered off by myself. Slowly the great leveler,
night, crept into the heart of things, and they seemed
glad. Orientals and natives from New Guinea lounged
about their little corrugated iron houses, obedient to
law and impulse for rest. Japanese kept off nakedness
with loose kimonos. One of them lay stretched upon the
mats before the open door, reading. Others squatted on
the highway. Tiny Japanese women walked stiffly on
their wooden <i>geta</i> as they do in Japan. Tiny babies
wandered about alone like wobbling pups. Upon the
sea-abandoned beach groups of New Guinea natives
gathered to search for crabs or other sea-food. A cow
waded into the water to cool herself. And the sail-boats,
beached with the receding tides, lunged landward.</p>

<p>Peace and evening. Nay, more. There is not only
indolent forgetfulness here; there is more than mere
ease in the tropics: there is affluence in ease. A something
enters the bone and sinew of moving creatures
which awakens and yet satisfies all the dearest desires.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
And nothing remains when night comes on but lamplight
and wandering white shadows.</p>

<p>Late that night I returned to the ship. Deep, familiar
sounds revived my memory of Fiji, on the other line
of my triangle. A chorus of New Guinea voices,&mdash;rich,
deep, harmonious, and rhythmic&mdash;rose from a little boat
beside us. In it were a half-dozen natives, squatting
round a lantern, reading and singing hymns in their own
tongue. Such mingled sadness with gladness,&mdash;one does
not know where one begins and the other ends. Shiny
black bodies crouching and chanting. Hymns never
seemed more sincere, more earnest.</p>

<p>They were waiting there for midnight to come, when
Sunday ends for them, and toil begins. The ship must
be loaded. Then voices will rattle with words and curses.
All night long they labored with good things for other
men. When I came out in the morning they breakfasted
on boiled yams and turtle, a mixture that looked like
dough. Instead of using their fingers, they employed
sharp pointed sticks, doubtless in imitation of Japanese
chop-sticks. Progress!</p>

<p>Shortly afterward we struck across the Arafua Sea,
and saw Australia no more.</p>

<small>OUR PEG IN ASIA</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>Venturing round the Pacific is like reincarnation.
One lives as an Hawaiian for a spell, enters a
state of non-existence and turns up as a Fijian; then another
period of selflessness, and so on from one isle to
another. From such a period of transmigration I woke
one morning to the sight of Zamboanga, and knew myself
for a moment as a dual personality,&mdash;a Filipino and an
American in one. All day long we hugged the coast of
the islands of the group&mdash;Mindanao, Negros, Panay,
Mindoro, Luzon&mdash;the cool blue surface of the choppy
sea between us and reality. After so many days' journey
along the coast of Australia, through sea after sea,
it seemed unreasonable to require a turn of the sun in
which to outstrip a few Oriental islands. Then we swung
to the right. Ahead of us, we were told, lay Manila,
but even the short run to that city seemed interminable.
At last the unknown became the known. A red trolley-car
emerged from behind the Manila Hotel. Life became
real again.</p>

<p>Our ship had hardly more than buoyed when a fleet of
lighters surrounded her,&mdash;flat, blunt, ordinary skiffs;
long, narrow, peculiar ones. The former I thought represented
American efficiency; the latter, Filipino whimsicality.
The Filipino craft were decorated in black,
with flourishes and letters in red and white. Over their
holds low hoods of matting formed an arch upon which
swarmed the native owners. How business-like, yet
withal attractive. And business became the order of the
night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>From beneath the matted hoods of the lighters flickered
glimmers of faint firelight. Life there was alert,
though quiet. It hid in the shadows of night; confined
in the holds, dim candles and lanterns quivered: peace
reigned before performance. A quiet harbor; moon and
stars and mast-lights above; a cool, refreshing breeze.
That was my first night in Manila Harbor.</p>

<p>Morning. Not really having stretched my legs in
nearly three weeks, since sailing from Sydney, Australia,
I naturally felt in high spirits upon landing. The mists
which hung over Manila quickened my pace, for I knew
that before I could see much of that ancient town they
would be gone, dissipated by the intense heat of the
tropical sun. I was eager to put on my seven-leagued
boots to see all that I had selected years before as the
things I wanted to stride the seas to see. But I soon
discovered that I was only a clumsy iron-weighted deep-sea
diver. All round the Pacific I had traveled alone.
I wanted no mate but freedom. But the three weeks <i>en
route</i> from the Antipodes, on board a small liner whose
major passenger list was made up of monosyllabic
Oriental names drove me, willy-nilly, into the companionship
of the septuagenarian English captain.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>On account of the keying down of my reactions to the
tempo of seventy-three plus British sedateness, I wrote
many things in my book of vistas that seem to me now
mere aberrations. Just to indicate what the effect was
I shall confess that as I approached the Walled City I
conceived of myself as almost a full-fledged Don Quixote
storming the citadel of ancient aggression. But my
elderly Sancho Panza held me back lest the shafts of
burning sunlight strike me down.</p>

<p>Standing before the gates of antiquity, even the most
haughty of human beings moves by instinct back along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the line of the ages, like a spider pulling himself up to
his nest on his web. Round the black stone wall which
encircles the old Spanish city, that which was once a moat
is now a pleasant grass-grown lawn. The wall itself, still
well preserved, has been overreached by two-story stone
houses with heavy balconies which seem to mock the pretenses
of their "protector." Outwardly, things look
old; within change has kept things new. Mixed with surprised
curiosity at two Antipodes so close together comes
a feeling of contact with eternity, the present of yesterday
linking itself with the antiquity which is to be.</p>

<p class="caption">THE DOCILE WATER BUFFALO IS USED TO WALKING IN MUD</p>
</div>

<p>A long, narrow street stretched across the city. Spanish
buildings tinted pink and delicately ornamented,
lined the sides. White stone buildings, chipped and
seamed with use and age, lined the way. Broad entrances
permitted glimpses of sumptuous patios, refreshed by
tropical plants; low stone steps leading up to dark vault-like
chambers; windows barred but without glass,&mdash;spacious
retreats built by caballeros who thought they
knew the value of life. Indeed, they knew how to build
against invasion of the sun and the Oriental pirate, but
not against the invasion of time. Perhaps they live
better as Spaniards to-day than they lived as conquerors
yesterday.</p>

<p>Here, within the walled city, everything looks as though
change were not the order of eternity. Everything is
as it was, yet nothing is so. Trolley-cars clank, motor-cars
of the latest models throb quietly, pony-traps and
bullock-carts stir the ancient quiet. One wonders how
so much new life can find room to move about in such
narrow streets with their still narrower sidewalks that
permit men to pass in single file only, and angular corners
and low buildings. But there they are, and there
they bid fair to remain. Even the unused cathedrals,
whose doors are here and there nailed shut, stand their
ground. Some of them even close the street with their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
imposing fronts, the courage of fervent human passion
in their crumbling fa&ccedil;ades.</p>

</div>

<p>At that early hour there was little sign of human life.
Into some of the cathedrals native women crept for
prayer. Here and there a confined human being passed
across the glassless windows; here and there a tourist
flitted by in search of sights. And I soon realized that
within the walls, intramuros, there was nothing. Across
the park, across the Pasig River, there one finds life.</p>

<p>Yet within that ancient crust there is new life. Some
old buildings have been turned into government offices,
high schools, a public library fully equipped, an agricultural
institute, everything standing as in days of old,
but new flowers and plants growing in those crude pots,&mdash;old
surroundings with a new spirit. Something mechanical
in that spirit,&mdash;typewriters clicking everywhere
under native fingers; still, typewriters don't click without
thoughts.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the conflict in growth between the ends
of time, heredity struggling with environment, the fountains
of youth washing the bones of old ambitions. They
may not become young bones, but may we not hope they
will at least be clean? May not time and patience remold
antiquity, absorb its bad blood and rejuvenate it?
Typewriters clicking everywhere; tongues born to Filipino,
then turned to Spanish, now twisting themselves
with English. The trough has been brought to the horse.
Will he drink? The library was full of intelligent-looking
young Filipinos, the cut of their clothes as obviously
American as the typewriters clicking behind
doors. Both typewriters and garments indicated efficiency,
but I could no more say what was the impulse
in the being within those clothes than what thoughts were
being fixed in permanence to the sound of an American
typewriter.</p>

<p>The most symbolical thing of all was the aquarium
built beneath one wing of the great wall round this little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
village. If in the hard shell of American possession arrangement
can still be made for the freedom, natural and
unconfining, of the native Filipinos, we shall not lay
ourselves open to censure. The natives may not be satisfied,
they may prefer the open sea; but that is up to
them to achieve. As long as we keep the water fresh
and the food supplies free, they can complain only of
their own crustaceous natures and nothing else.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>All Manila does not live within the walls, however,&mdash;not
even a goodly portion of it,&mdash;and the exits are numerous.
Passing through the eastern gate, one comes
into a park which lies between the walled city and the
Pasig River. Beyond the river and on its very banks
is Manila proper. As I got my first glimpse of the
crowded, dirty waterway, I could not say much in reply
to my companion, whose patriotic fervor found expression
in criticism of American colonization. It was like
looking into a neglected back yard. The Englishman
did not seem to see, however, that to have done better in
so short a time would have been to inflict hardships on
the natives which no amount of progress ever justifies.
Still, with memories of Honolulu as a basis for judgment
I was not a little disappointed. How to change
people without destroying their souls,&mdash;that is the problem
for future social workers for world betterment to
solve.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had succeeded in eluding my burden of
seventy-three years and opened my eyes to the life round
about me. There was still a bridge to cross. It was
narrow, wooden and crowded. It was only a temporary
structure, built to replace the magnificent Bridge of
Spain which was washed away in the great flood of September,
1914. During the few minutes it took me to
saunter across it, the traffic was twice blocked. Per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>haps
to show me how full the traffic was, for in that
moment there lined up as many vehicles and people and
of sufficient variety to illustrate the stepping-stones in
transportation progress. There were traps, motor-cars,
carts drawn by carabao, or water-buffalo, bicycles, and
trolley-cars. Everybody seems to ride in some fashion.</p>

<p>Yet everybody seems to walk, and in single file at
that. Gauze-winged Filipino women,&mdash;tawdry, small
and ill-shod, or, rather, dragging slippers along the pavement&mdash;insist
on keeping to the middle of the narrow
walks. Frequently they are balancing great burdens on
their heads, with or without which they are not over-graceful
or comely. Their stiff, transparent gauze
sleeves stand away from them like airy wings. One
hasn't the heart to brush against them lest these angelic
extensions be demolished, and so one keeps behind them
all the way.</p>

<p>The men also shuffle along. They wear embroidered
gauze coats which veil their shirts and belts and trousers.
There is something in this lace-curtain-like costume that
seems the acme of laziness. Neither stark nakedness
nor the durability of heavy fabrics seem so prohibitive
of labor as does this thin garment. No inquiry into the
problem of the Philippines would seem to me complete
without full consideration of the origin of this costume.</p>

<p>But one is swept along over the bridge, and is dropped
down into Manila proper by way of a set of steps,
through a short alley. The main street opens to the
right and to the left. It is brought to a sudden turn one
block to the left and then runs on into the farther reaches
of the city; to the right it winds its way along till it encompasses
the market-place and confusion. This chiseling
out of streets in such abrupt fashion is puzzling to
the person with notions of how tropical people behave.
Why such timidity in the pursuance of direction and desire?
The obstruction of the bridge promenade by the
main street and of the main street by a side street have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
a tendency to shoot the seer of sights about in a fashion
comparable to one of those games in which a ball is shot
through criss-cross sections so that the players never
know in what little groove it will fall or whether the number
will be a lucky one or not.</p>

<p>I first fell into a bank, and the amount of money one
can lose in exchanging Australian silver notes into American
dollars is sufficient to dishearten one. The shops
were too damp and insignificant to attract me much,
however, so I ventured on into the outer by-ways of
the city. There the dungeon-like stores and homes and
Chinese combinations had at least the virtue of ordinary
Oriental manner in contrast to our own. The Chinese
cupboard-like stores, that seem to hang on the outside
of the buildings like Italian fruit-stands, held few attractions.
There was an obvious utilitarianism about
them which, strange as it may seem, is the last thing
the man with no fortune to spend enjoys. Shops and
museums afford the unpossessing compensation for his
penury.</p>

<p>As I made my way ahead to a small open square, my
attention was arrested by a performance the full significance
of which did not at first appear to me. At the
gateway of a large cigar-factory from which came strolling
male and female workers, sat two individuals&mdash;two
women at the women's gate, two men at the men's&mdash;and
each worker was examined before leaving. As a
woman came along, the inspector passed her hands down
the side of the skirts, up the thighs, over the bosom,&mdash;then
slapped her genially and off she went. Through it
all, the girls assumed a most dignified manner, absolutely
without self-consciousness and oblivious of the gaze of
the passers-by. What is more certain to break down
a man's or a woman's self-respect than becoming indifferent
to the opinion of the public as to the method of being
searched? A Freudian complex formed to the point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of one's believing oneself capable of theft, the next thing
is to live out that unconscious thought of theft and to
care nothing for the censure of the world.</p>

<p>When at work, these girls possessed a sort of sixth
sense. The cigarettes are handed over to them at their
benches to be wrapped in bundles of thirty. They never
stop to count them&mdash;just place the required number in
their left hands encircling them with thumb and fingers,
reject an odd one if it creeps in, and tie the bundle. I
counted a dozen packets, but did not find one either short
or over, and the overseers are so certain of this accuracy
that they never count them either.</p>

<p>But what a different world is found at the public school
not very far from the factory! The building was not
much of a building,&mdash;just an old-fashioned wooden structure
with a court. Its sole purpose seemed to be to furnish
four thousand children with training in the use of
a new tongue. "Speak English," stared every one in
the face from sign-boards nailed to pillars. I listened.
The command was honored more in the breach than in
the observance, yet where it was respected strange English
sounds tripped along tongues that were doubtless
more accustomed to Tagalog and Spanish. There was
nothing shy in the behavior of these boys and girls. They
moved about with a certain monastic self-assurance, less
gay than our children, more free than most Oriental
youngsters. In a few years they will be advocating Filipino
independence, in no mistaken terms,&mdash;if they have
not been caught by the factory process.</p>

<p>I went straight ahead and found myself on my way
back into the city,&mdash;but from a side opposite that from
which I had left it. The squalor and the dungeon-like
atmosphere were indeed nothing for American efficiency
to be proud of. Slums in the tropics fester rapidly.
One cannot say these places were slums; but they certainly
were not native villages. One felt that here in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Manila America's heart was not in her work. Why build
up something that would in the end revert to the natives,
to be laid open to possible aggression and conquest!
One felt further that the Filipinos did not exactly rejoice
in being Americans. What they actually are they have
long since forgotten. Once foster-children of Philip
of Spain. To-day the adopted sons of America. To-morrow?
How much more fortunate their Siamese
cousins or relatives by an ancient marriage! Yet all
who know Manila as it was ten years ago agree that
there have been vast improvements in a decade. One
does not include in this generalization the residences and
hotels of the foreigners, for obvious reasons; still, the
welfare of a community is raised by good example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That afternoon I stretched in the shade of one of the
walls of the old walled citadel with its fine gateways.
I pondered the significance of those stones against which
I was resting. One gains strength from such structures
as one does from the sea,&mdash;not only in the actual contact,
but in the thought that that which human effort accomplished
human effort can do again. My septuagenarian
had returned to the ship for rest. I thought of his
criticisms of the American occupation of Manila, of his
suggestions that England would have made of it a fine
city. I wondered what drove the Spanish to build this
wall. To protect themselves against Chinese pirates?
There is not a country in the world that has not tried to
safeguard itself against invasion by the process of invasion.
Yet any attempt to do otherwise is decried as impractical.
All the while, decay weakens the arm of the
conqueror.</p>

<p>But more luring scenes distracted my thoughts. The
sinking sun stretched the lengthening shadows of the
wall as a fisherman, at sunset, spreads his serviceable
nets. Filipinos passed quietly to and fro; cars, motor-cars,
and electric cars cut a St. Andrew's cross before me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
The scent of mellow summer weighted the air. Slowly
everything drew closer in the net of night.</p>

<p>Two days later I was in Hong-Kong, where the Oriental
dominates the scene. I was at the third angle of the
triangle, and hereafter the subject is Asia.</p>

<small>BRITAIN'S ROCK IN ASIA</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>To one who had received his most vivid impressions
of China from her noblest philosopher, Lao-tsze,
it was somewhat disconcerting to peep through the porthole
just after dawn and find oneself the center of a confusion
indescribable. The sleepy, heaving sea was more
in tune with the mystic "Way" of the great sage. I
had not anticipated being thrust so suddenly among the
masses and the babel on which Lao-tsze, that gray-beard
child, had tried to pour some intellectual oil.</p>

<p>Yet, I had been living on the top floor of a Chinese
"den" for twenty-six days between Sydney and Hong-Kong.
On board I was ready to blame the steamship
company for the crowding and the uncleanliness. Had
there been a dozen murders, I should not have regarded
it as unnatural. Had I been compelled to spend three
weeks in such circumstances, I should either have committed
hara-kiri or killed off at least four hundred and
fifty-five to make the decent amount of room necessary for
the remaining fifty. So I was prepared to exonerate
them, to praise them for their pacifism and their orderliness
in such conditions.</p>

<p>But when I peeped out of the porthole that morning
and saw the swarming thousands struggling with one
another to secure a pittance of privilege, which these
five hundred had to offer by way of baggage, my heart
went out to the great sage of 650 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> He must have
been courageous indeed.</p>

<p>Full families of them on their shallow sampans co<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>operating
with one another against odds which would
sicken the stoutest-hearted white folk. Yet in that
Oriental mass there was the ever-present exultation of
spirit. Laughter and good-natured bullying, full recognition
of the other man's right to rob and be robbed.
No smug morality teaching you to be shy and generous
in the face of an obviously bad world, a world ordered so
as to make goodness the most expensive instead of the
least expensive quality. But I soon discovered that beneath
that external jollity only too frequently fluttered a
fearful heart, filled with dread of the slightest change
of circumstances.</p>

<p>The distance between the ship and the shore was not
like Charon's river Styx, but it was a way between the
Elysium of an alien metropolis and a Hades of hopeless
nativity, none the less. Beyond stood the towering hills
of Hong-Kong with its massive palaces in marble at the
very summit. Chinese will to live had builded these,
but the people had not, it seems, enough will left to build
for themselves. From the very foot of the hills upward
rose a steady series of buildings which looked surprisingly
familiar, yet somewhat alien to my expectations.
It was something of a shock to me to find that Hong-Kong
was Chinese in name and character only, while being
European-owned and ordered. I felt fooled. I had
gone to see China, but found only another outpost of
Great Britain. My American passport had had most
fascinating Chinese characters on the back of it. But
the "Emergency Permit" issued to me in Sydney, had
none. Between British ports one can always expect
British courtesy and that largeness of heart which comes
from having taken pretty nearly all there is worth while
in the world without being afraid of losing it. So I made
some hurried mental adjustments as we chugged our
way across, amidst bobbing sampans, and convinced myself
that it might have been worse.</p>

<p>In that great future which will put modern civilization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
somewhere half-way between the Stone Age and itself,
the stones of Hong-Kong will give investigators much to
think about. Everything in Hong-Kong is concrete and
stone. From the spacious office buildings that stand
along the waterfront, to the palaces upon the peak, stone
is the material out of which everything is built. What
achievement! What a monument to Britain! But as the
stones become harder beneath one's feet, one senses the
toil embodied in them. Male and female coolies still
trudge over these stony paths, carrying baskets of
gravel, tar, or sand higher and higher. These structures
seemed to me like human bridges which great leaders of
men sometimes lay for their armies to pass over. Where
do they lead to? Perhaps to England's greatness; perhaps
to the world's shame.</p>

<p>At first one is prone to be rigid in one's judgment.
There seems too much evidence of desire to build
securely, rather than humanely or beautifully. The
Orient, one hears, builds more daintily, more softly, more
picturesquely; America builds more comfortably and
more thoroughly. One might add, apologetically, that
had not the masters driven these coolies to such stony
tasks, the poor creatures would simply have built another
Chinese wall at the behest of one of their own tyrants.
Cheap labor makes pyramids and walls, and palaces on
the peaks of Hong-Kong. But it also makes an unsightly
slough of humanity about itself. Considering how costly
pyramids and palaces such as those at Hong-Kong are,
considering the plodding toil it took to build them, for
the sake of humanity it is better that they were built of
stone, so that rebuilding may never be necessary.</p>

<p>Everywhere as we climb we pass rest stations, coolies
buying a few cents' worth of food, coolies carrying
cement. While far beneath lies murky, moldy Hong-Kong
with its worm-like streets, its misty harbor waters,
its hundreds of steamers, sail-boats, sampans, piers, and
dry-docks, and all around stand the peaks of earth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the inverted peaks of air. Returning by another route,
down more winding and more precipitous paths, one
passes great concrete reservoirs, tennis-courts, an incline
railway, water-sheds,&mdash;and the city again.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>The days draw on even here, and sunlight is curtained
by dim night. The din of human voices loses its shrill
tone of bargaining, the rickshaw men trot regularly but
more slowly. Carriers of sedan-chairs lag beneath their
loads; their steps slow down to a walk. Women by the
dozen slip by, still with their burdens, but their voices
have a note of softness, pleasing sadness. And now
comes the time of day when no matter in what station
one's life may be cast, spirit and body shift to better
adjustment. And through the dim blue mist the shuffling
of feet is heard, or the sounding of loose wooden slippers
like drops of water in a well. Whatever revived activities
may follow this twilight hour, now, for the world
entire, is rest,&mdash;even in toil-worn, grubbing, groveling
China, which seems not to have been born to rest.</p>

<p>"Business" is not yet gone from the streets of Hong-Kong,
though it is now wholly dark. Every one is working
as though the day were but just beginning and it were
not Sunday night. It is impossible to select "important"
things from out this heap of human debris. Filth,
odors, activity, jewelry, dirty little heaps and packets
of food,&mdash;all are handled over and over again, and each
one is content with a lick of the fingers for the handling.
Then when quite worn out one may rest his bones on
the pavement covered with straw or mat, or if more
fortunate, may have a hovel or a house in which to breed.
The number of homeless wretches sleeping on the inclined
stone pavements of Hong-Kong was simply appalling.
And Hong-Kong is British made. Hong-Kong was a
barren island twenty-nine miles in area when seventy-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>five
years or so ago Britain demanded it from China;
to-day its population is nearly a tenth of that of the
whole continent of Australia. But what a difference in
the status of that population! Certainly no man who
sees the result of over-population in proportion to a
people's industrial ingenuity can blame Australia for
keeping herself under reproductive self-control.</p>

<p>A few of the things one sees as a matter of course
in Hong-Kong will illustrate. As I was coming down
Pottinger Street I was horror-struck at the sight of a
small boy on his knees groaning and wailing as though
he were in unendurable agony. I thought at first he
was having a fit, but it became obvious that there was
method in his madness. He was repeating some incantation,
bowing his head to the ground, tapping frantically
with a tin can on the stones, and chanting or
shrieking out his blessings or his curses, which ever the
case may have been. He was a blind beggar, and though
he must have received more money than many a coolie
does (for even Chinese have coins to give) and in a way
certainly earned it, I could not but smile at his wisdom,&mdash;for
at its worst it was no worse than the labor of the
coolie. Yet from many passers-by he evoked only slight
amusement.</p>

<p>Upon some steps in an unlighted thoroughfare stood
a Chinese haranguing a crowd. His voice was not
unpleasant, his manner was persuasive. But what to?
Had he been urging China to stop breeding, to cease this
worm-like living and reproducing, I should have regarded
him as a public benefactor. For it made me creepy, this
proximity to such squirming numbers.</p>

<p>Beside a dirty wall around the corner was a medicine
man selling a miraculous bundle of herbs. He screeched
its powers, gave each a smell, which each one took since
it cost nothing, and then he went into frightful contortions
to demonstrate that which these herbs could allay. But
from the expression on his face it was obvious they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
not allay his disappointment that the purchasers were
few.</p>

<p>At an open store was a crowd. I edged my way up to
see the excitement. It was a "doctor's operating-room."
Upon a bench sat an old man, gray-haired and almost
toothless. The "doctor" stood astride the patients' knees
and with a steel instrument, somewhat rusty, calmly and
carelessly stirred about in the old man's eyeless socket.
All the sufferer did was to mutter "Ta, ta, ta," pausing
slightly between the ta's, but never stirring. No guarding
against infection out on the open, dusty, dirty
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>The crowd looked on without any sign of emotion. A
few women sat on a bench inside, but seemed quite indifferent.
There was one exception. A little mother with
a boy of about six contemplated the performance with a
pained expression. Her boy's eyes were crossed and
turned upward. He had to be treated, too.</p>

<p>Finally even these things end. It is nine o'clock.
Shops are closing, the crowds on the streets die down.
And for one brief spell the world will rest.</p>

<p>Here we have four examples of life in China. When
we examine them closely, haphazardly chosen as they
have been, there is a strange uniformity and contradiction
in their basic situations. The blind beggar-boy, the
charlatan advocate and medicine man, the careless surgeon,&mdash;at
bottom all charlatans, yet all essentially sincere.
That ranting little beggar howled his lying
appeals, but at home, no doubt, were other mouths to be
fed for which he&mdash;blind head of the family&mdash;was responsible.
The herb-specialist seemed, from the tone of his
voice, sincere in the belief in his remedies; the surgeon,
certain of his operation. Yet that is what China is suffering
from most, and because of the faith in their crude
panaceas and the conviction that five thousand years of
tradition gives folk, the Rockefeller Foundation will have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to work for many generations before it will make China
prophylactic.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>There was another incident that illustrated, to me at
least, China's ailment. Hong-Kong seemed possessed
one night. I thought a riot or a revolution had broken
out, but it was only a house on fire. Thousands of Chinese
scurried about like rats looking for ways of escape.
From the littered roof and balcony of a five-story tenement
a flame leaped skyward as though itself trying to
escape from the unpleasant task of consuming so dirty
a structure. The curious collected in hordes from everywhere.</p>

<p>I made my way into this mass not unaware of being
quite alone in the world. It was interesting to be in
this sort of mob. The reason for China's subjugation
showed itself in the ease with which it was controlled.
One single white policeman, running back and forth along
the length of a block, kept the whole mob well along the
curb. It was amazing to watch the crowd retreat at the
officer's approach and then bulge out as soon as he
passed by. One young Chinese stood out a little too far.
The officer came up on his rear, yanked him by the ear,
and sent him scurrying back into the mob. They who
dared rushed timidly across the street. I remarked this
to the policeman. He was pleased. "If you want to get
closer up, just walk straight ahead," he said. And so
I did, as did other white men who arrived, without being
stopped. That was it: we were quite different; we could
go. Later a host of special police, Chinese and Indian
regulars, arrived and relieved this lone white officer.</p>

<p>This incident seemed to me to symbolize China's present
state. No leader, no cohesion, no common thinking.
Had the mob been resentful,&mdash;what then! It was a mob
the like of which I had never seen before. A dull murmur
sounded through all the confusion. It seemed to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
of one tone, as though all the notes of the scale were
sung at once and they blended into one another like the
colors of the spectrum. The people seemed wonderfully
alert. Their hearing was keen. Two tram-car conductors
conversed forty feet away from each other, with
dozens of yapping Chinese between.</p>

<p>Thus, China enjoys a oneness like that of water. Easily
separated, lightly invaded, rapidly reunited, her masses
flow on together when directed into any channel, and it
matters little where or why. And the white policeman
assured me that when the Chinese still wore queues a
policeman raided a den and tied the queues of fifteen
Chinese together and with these as reins drove them
to prison.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>Yet, what nation or race in the world has maintained
such indivisibility against so much separation! Think
of what the family is and has been to China,&mdash;its creeds,
its government, its entire existence. Yet the family and
concubinage obtain side by side.</p>

<p>There was evidence of this in British Hong-Kong.
Upon the street one day I saw another crowd. It was
waiting for the appearance of the Governor of Canton.
When the worthy governor emerged from a very
unworthy-looking building, the crowd cheered and gathered
close around the automobile.</p>

<p>A well-dressed young Chinese in European clothes
emerged from the hall. I asked him what was toward,
surmising his understanding. He spoke English fluently
and seemed pleased to inform me. So we strolled down
the street together. He was not very hopeful about
Chinese democracy as yet, but believed in it and
expressed great admiration for America. Britain, he
said, was not well liked. He spoke of his religion, his
belief in Confucianism. He regretted that Hong-Kong
had no temples and that he and his friends were compelled
to meet at the club for prayer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet though he was a Confucianist, he decried the
family system. "Chinese cling too much to family," he
said. "One man goes to America, then he sends for a
brother simply because he is a relative. The brother
may be a very bad character, but that doesn't matter.
So it is in official circles in China to-day. Graft goes on,
jobs are dispensed to relatives worthy or unworthy, efficient
or inefficient. And the country is getting deeper
and deeper into difficulties."</p>

<p>As though to prove the truth of his assertions, he told
me of his own experiences as a child. "Chinese obey,"
he said. "My father paid for my education, therefore
my duty toward him should know no bounds." His
father had had ten children, only two of whom survived,&mdash;he
and an elder sister. When his father died,
he became the head of the family. Therefore he had to
marry, even though then only fifteen years of age. He
had been married for sixteen years. I should never have
believed it, to judge from his appearance. He seemed no
more than a student himself, but he assured me he had
five children,&mdash;one daughter fifteen years old. Birth-control!
Limitation of offspring! Why bother? If
his father could "raise" a family of ten on "nothing"
and then just let them die off,&mdash;why not he? So does
duty keep the race alive.</p>

<p>And duty tolerates that which is sapping the very
foundation of the race,&mdash;not only the enslavement of the
wife in such circumstances, but the entertainment of the
concubine. I saw the way that works.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the city is the quarter where
the concubines abound. Life there does not begin till
eight o'clock in the evening, if as early. The clanging
of cans and the effort at music is terrifying. Hotels of
from four to five stories, with all their balconies illuminated,
gave an effect of festive cheerfulness which the
rest of the city lacked utterly.</p>

<p>Upon the ground floors, which opened directly upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the street, the women could be seen dressing for the
evening. Nothing in their behavior or dress would indicate
their profession,&mdash;so unlike the licensed districts
of Japan. The women never as much as noticed any
stranger on the street. At the appointed time each little
woman emerged, dainty, clean and sober, and passed
from her own quarters to the hotels and restaurants
where she was to meet her chartered libertine. Her
decorum approximated saintly modesty, and she moved
with a childlike innocence. There was throughout the
district no rowdyism, no disorderliness. Everything was
businesslike and according to regulation. Strange, that
with so much self-control should go so much licentiousness.
But it is part of the mystery of the Orient.</p>

<p>Yet, this is no stranger than that with so much of excellence
in Hong-Kong, there should also go the perpetuation
of coolieism; to paraphrase, that with so much
dignity and honesty in trade should go so much inhumanity
in the treatment of men. That is the mystery of
Britannia,&mdash;and her success. America went into the
Orient and immediately began educating it. In answer to
a German criticism of British educational work in Hong-Kong,
the "Japan Chronicle" (British) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Considering how much greater British interests in China have hitherto
been than American, the Americans are far more guilty of the
abominable crime of educating the Chinese than the British, having
spent a great deal of money, and induced young Chinese to come to
America and get Americanized. Most people, including impartial
British subjects, would find fault rather with the narrow limits of
English education in China than with its intentions. Hongkong has
been for many years the center of an enormously profitable trade,
and had things been done with the altruism that one would like to
see in international relations, there would be ten universities instead
of only one and a hundred students sent to England for college or
technical training where only one is sent to-day.</p></div>

<p>Hitherto, it has been Britain's success that she has not
interfered with the habits of the races she has ruled. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Hong-Kong she has built a modern city out of nothing,
but has permitted Asiatic defects to find their place
within it.</p>

<p>For instance, there was no sewerage system in Hong-Kong,&mdash;a
fact than which no greater criticism could be
made of Britain, or of any other nation pretending to be
civilized. In this no question of altruism is involved, but
purely one of self-interest. And if greater concern for
such matters were manifest, doubtless it would work
its way back through concubinage, ancestor worship,
charlatanism in public and private life.</p>

<p>Having taken my chances with criticism, I shall risk
praise. Englishmen have never, to my knowledge, been
given credit for the possession of romantic souls; yet
nothing but a deep love of romance could be responsible
for the manner in which Britain has preserved Hong-Kong's
Chinese face. Despite the fact that it is entirely
Western in its structure, I never felt the Oriental flavor
more in all Japan than I did at Hong-Kong. The sedan-chairs
that take one up the steeps and remind one of
the swells on the China Sea in their motion, the thousands
of rickishaws that roll swiftly, quietly over smoothly
paved streets, the particularly attractive Chinese signs
that lure one into dazzling shops with unmistakable
Eastern atmosphere, the money-changers and the markets
dripping with Oriental messes, left an impression
on my mind that none of my later experiences can dispel.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>CHINA'S EUROPEAN CAPITAL</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>Under the benign influence of a Salvation Army
captain, my feet were guided safely through some
of the lesser evils of Shanghai. The greater could not
be fathomed in the short time allotted to me in the European
capital of China. Miss Smythe, who resented
being called Smith, in a manner that revealed she had
long since ceased to be shy of mere man, belonged to
New Zealand by birth and heaven by adoption. She
chose Hong-Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo as temporary
resting-places. It was her task, every five years or so,
to make a complete tour of the Orient to collect funds
for the Salvation Army. Hence her captaincy.</p>

<p>I was walking along Queens Street, Hong-Kong, somewhat
lone in spirit, when a rickshaw passed quickly by.
The occupant, a fair lady, bowed pleasantly to me and
disappeared in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. I could not recall ever having
seen her face and wondered who in Hong-Kong she could
be. Then it struck me that she wore a hat with bright
red on it. Later that day, as I stepped into the launch
to be taken across to the <i>Tamba Maru</i>, who should appear
but this selfsame lady. We greeted each other, both surprised
at the second meeting and at the coincidence of
our joining the same ship.</p>

<p>"I thought I had met you when I greeted you on the
street this morning," she said.</p>

<p>All the way from Hong-Kong to Shanghai she was as
busy going from class to class as she was on shore,
spreading the faith, placing literature where it could be
found and read, organizing hymn parties and discourag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>ing
booze. The Japanese on board took her good-naturedly.
She spoke their language fluently, but I could
not see that they drank one little cup of sak&eacute; the less
for her.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Shanghai she would have nothing
else but that I should go with her to some friends of
hers for dinner. Into one rickshaw she loaded her bags,
into another me, with the manner of one handling cargo,
and then deposited herself in a third. The train made
its way along the Bund and out of confusion. And that
was the way I was shanghaied.</p>

<p>Somewhere in a street that might for all the world
have been in Chicago, our train drew up. It was quiet,
had a little open park in it, where two streets seemed
to have got mixed and, scared at losing their identity
like the Siamese twins, ran off in an angle of directions.
Here at a brick-red building with balconies and porticoes,
and a dark, damp door, we made our announcement and
were received. Now what would the world have thought
if a Salvation Army man had picked up a strange young
woman on a steamer and haled her into a strange house?
None but a Salvation Army Lassie could have done what
Miss Smythe,&mdash;not Smith, mind you!&mdash;dared to do. We
were welcomed as though the appearance of a stranger
were in the usual course of events, and I was asked to
stay for dinner. The hostess, a quiet woman, with her
pretty young daughter, kept a boarding-house, and was
always prepared for extra folk.</p>

<p>It was a boarding-house like any I should have
expected to find in America. The rooms were spacious,
hung with framed prints, and dark and slightly damp,
according to Shanghai climate. There was something
haunting about the house, but to a homeless vagabond
like myself it seemed the acme of comfort. And to one
who had had no real home meal in five weeks or more,
but only ship's food, the spread we sat down to was
delicious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Smythe did not enjoy her dinner as much as I
did, for she feared all along that she would not be able
to get to church on time. Then it was too late for me
to regain my ship, so I was invited to spend the night
under a roof instead of a deck.</p>

<p>The next day I wandered off by myself, but not till
I had promised to return for Chinese "chow." In the
meantime Miss Smythe had spread my fame among
others of her profession, and made a date for me to go
to a "rescue house" or some such place that evening.
It was a mission home for Japanese, run by a woman
who, if she wasn't from Boston, I'm sure must have
come from Brookline. The only thing Oriental about
that mission was its Japanese. A sumptuous dinner was
served which, despite the fact that I had had "chow"
only twenty minutes before, I was compelled to eat. With
two heavy meals where one is accustomed to berth, accommodations
were somewhat crowded.</p>

<p>Everything would have gone well if I hadn't promised
to give the residents a talk on my travels. I began. Miss
Smythe felt that I wasn't emphasizing the presence
of God in the numerous regions I had visited. I took
His omnipresence for granted, but she kept breaking
into my talk at every turn. Two meals inside of two
people who both tried to lecture at once didn't go
very well, especially at a mission in China run by
Europeans and attended by Japanese. It seemed that
there was not over-much love lost on the part of the
sons of Tenno for those of the Son of Heaven, nor
did the European missionaries at this place encourage
the intermarriage of these illustrious spirits. The
Bostonian in exile on more than one occasion spoke
disparagingly of the cleanliness of the Chinese, much to
the satisfaction of the Japanese. But then, she was winning
and holding them to the Son of God, and when they
reached heaven they would all be one. Miss Smythe
afterward apologized to me for interrupting me during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
my talk, and we parted as cordially as we had met. Some
months later I found her roaming the streets of Kobe,
Japan, as active as ever in the militant cause. Her
insinuations about what goes on in Japanese inns seemed
to me unjustifiable. So I asked her whether it was fair
to the Japanese and Chinese for her to be forever repeating
hearsay when she would resent it were I to repeat
what I had heard about the morality of the Australians.
It took her aback, but I am sure that she is still pursuing
vice and drink and irreverence, aided and abetted by the
dollars which she extracts from foreign business men
and reprobates throughout the East.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>But I must get back to Shanghai, even though Miss
Smythe is so attractive. As long as I remained under
her wing I had taken virtually no notice of China. So
it is in Shanghai; one cannot see the Orient for the Occidentals.
For if Hong-Kong is an example of adulterated
British imperialism, Shanghai is one of European
internationalism grafted upon China. At Shanghai the
forces of two contending racial streams meet, like the
waters at the entrance of Port Philip, and here, though
the surface is smooth and glassy, there are eddies and
whirlpools within, which are a menace to any small craft
that may attempt to cross.</p>

<p>How strange to wander about streets and buildings
quite European but to see only here and there a white
face! It is an ultra-modern city built upon a flat plain.
The streams of Chinese that come wandering in from
regions unknown to the transient, give him a sense of
contact with a vast, endless world beyond. They might
be coming from just round the corner, but their manner
is of plainsmen bringing their goods and chattels to
market. In comparison with the Southern Chinese, these
are giants, but still dirty and most of them chestless. In
constant turmoil and travail, beggars pleading for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
pittance with which to sustain their empty lives, limousines
making way for themselves between rickshaws and
one-wheeled barrows, coolies pulling and carrying loads,
some grunting as they jig their way along, others chanting
in chorus,&mdash;yet all in the "foreign" settlement, amid
buildings that are alien to them, and largely for men
who see only the gain they here secure. I wonder if
the Chinese say of the Europeans as Americans are often
heard to say of Italians and Orientals,&mdash;that they come
only to make money and return to spend it?</p>

<p>Yet the white have built Shanghai. Shanghai is not
Chinese. Had it not been for the white men, the plain
would still be swampy, would still be a litter of hovels
with here and there a mansion flowering in the mud. The
mud still messes up the edge of things in Shanghai. The
creek is an example. There are the sampans and barges,
some loaded with pyramid-like stacks of hay, some with
heavy, thick-walled mahogany coffins, the myriads of
families huddling within the holds, and the murky tides
washing in and washing out beneath them. Here the
sexes live in greater intimacy, it seemed to me, than in
Hong-Kong. I actually saw one woman place her hand
in what I was sure was an affectionate way on the
shoulder of a man: and some were mutually helpful. But
otherwise, despite the great conglomeration and greater
co&ouml;peration, in the entire mass one cannot see how ancestor-worshipers
can show so little regard for one another.</p>

<p>In the market-place the confusion is more orderly.
Here even white women come to stock up their kitchens,
and here Japanese women move about, sober by nature
and by virtue of the superiority they possess as conquerors
in their husbands' rights. Two girls are quarreling
vociferously and the more self-controlled look on
both sympathetically and antipathetically. The washed-down
pavement of the market floor is no place, however,
for a serious bout.</p>

<p>Through the long hours of early evening I wandered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
into one street and out the other. I had become more
or less reconciled to the alien aspects of Shanghai, to
good stores selling good goods, to fashionable hotels and
spacious residences, but one thing was inalienably alien
to it, and that was a second-hand book-shop. It had not
occurred to me that foreigners in China would part with
their books if they ever got hold of them. And for a
moment I was altogether transported, and my magic
carpet lay in San Francisco, in Chicago, in New York
all at once. But it was chilly and the rain made the city
worse than a washed-down market, for it depopulated
the streets, leaving me as dreary in heart as in body.
I was glad when the hour came for me to make my
appearance at the kind woman's house for chow.</p>

<p>Though I was sorry to hear the missionary at the mission
decry the Chinese to the satisfaction of her Japanese
patrons, and felt that it turned me slightly against both,
still both Japanese and missionaries were kind and attentive
to me. In the evening, a young Japanese business
man called for a motor-car and took us out in the bleak,
wet night to see the great white way of Shanghai. The
rain deflected the strange glimmers of electric light
through the isinglassed curtains of the car. For a time
we skidded along over slushy streets, turning into the
theater district as the attraction supreme. Here the gonfalons
drooped in the watery air, while Chinese mess merchants
stood in out of the rain with their little wagonettes
of steaming portions. In a whirl we were through the
cluttering crowds and making for the residential districts.
Then wide avenues opened out in serpentine ways, shaggy
trees dripping overhead, the slippery pavement swinging
us from side to side as our dare-devil Chinese driver sped
on to Bubbling Well. For an hour we rode, I did not
know whither, but everywhere at my right and left were
palatial Chinese and foreign residences. Without knowing
it we had turned and were back in Shanghai, and
presently within doors again,&mdash;and asleep.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<h4>3</h4>

<p>Next day, this same Japanese business man volunteered
to escort me to Chinese City. I would have gone
by myself, but every one looked horrified at the idea; so
I accepted this knightly guide. At the appointed time I
presented myself at his office. He had asked his Chinese
clerk to accompany us for protection, and ordered three
rickshaws. Though he had lived in Shanghai for years,
he had never gone to see Chinese City, and was glad to
avail himself of an excuse for doing so now. The Japanese
is a natural-born cicerone.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we had left the international section
of the settlement&mdash;that jointly occupied by Britain and
America&mdash;and wobbled into the French district. Suddenly
we stopped, and our carriers lowered their shafts
to the ground. We were at a narrow opening three or
four feet wide, and I could not understand why we should
pay our respects to it. "From here we have to walk,"
said the Chinese, and in single file we entered, dropping
out of Shanghai as into a bog. That was real China,
but only as little Italy in New York is real Italy.</p>

<p>The whole of Chinese City can be summed up hastily
and in but a few words. Narrow, dirty little thoroughfares
laid out in broken stone paving, tiny shops where
luxuries, necessities, and coolie requisites are sold,&mdash;dark,
dirty, open to the damp! What destitution is the
inheritance of these thousands of years of civilization!</p>

<p>The first thing to greet us, standing out against the
general wretchedness, was not beautiful. To one accustomed
to hard sights and scenes, to one not easily perturbed
by human degradation, that which passed as we
entered was sufficient to unnerve him. Upon the wet,
filthy street rolled a legless boy. He had no crutches;
his business required none. He was begging: howling,
chanting, and rolling all at the same time. I could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
say "Poor child!" Rather, poor China, that it should
come to this!</p>

<p>Immediately after, though having no business connections,
came an old man. Came? Walked crouching,
bowing his gray head till it touched the filthy pathway.
He was kotowing before the menials of China, not its
empress.</p>

<p>The third was the worst of all. One old, ragged,
broken beggar was carrying on his back what might have
been a corpse, but was another beggar; the two&mdash;one on
top of the other&mdash;were not more than four feet above
the ground.</p>

<p>I felt as though Mara, the Evil One, was trying to
frighten me by an exhibition of his pet horrors so that
I might not go farther. I was not being perturbed, the
horrors ceased.</p>

<p>But what beauties or treasures were they meant to
guard? What was there that I was not to see? What
ogre dwelt within? Nothing but a bit of business, so
to speak, in a social bog.</p>

<p>Beside a tideless creek, advertised as a lake, stood a
pagoda-like structure, just a broken reflection imaged
in the mud. As we approached we were immediately
taken in charge by a Chinese guide and led along a path
crudely paved with cobblestones into an "ancient" tea-garden.
The wall around it was topped with a vicious-looking
dragon that stretched around it. A tremendous
monster of wood, it lay there; and perhaps it will continue
to lie there long after China shall have forsaken the
dragon. Then from chamber to chamber we strolled, past
tables of stone and shrines and effigies, and into the heart
of China's superstitious soul. Though in itself not ancient,
what a peep it afforded into antiquity,&mdash;dull, dead,
yet powerful!</p>

<p>For within these secret chambers there were displayed
endless numbers of emperors and their dynastic celebrities.
In one chamber, blue with smoke and stifling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
incense, lighted with red candles, burning joss-sticks,
behung with lanterns, and crowded with lazy Chinese,
we found several "emperors" with red-painted wooden
effigies of their wives. To me the smoke was choking;
not so to them. The incense was sweet in their nostrils,
and nourishing. And in payment for the sacrificial generosity
and the prayers of fat, wealthy Chinese women
who fell upon their knees, rose, and fell again, bowing
and repeating incantations, they were to make the husbands
of these women&mdash;too busy to come themselves&mdash;meet
with success in business. Seriousness and earnestness
marked the features of these women, and who can
say their faith was ignored?</p>

<p>We emerged from this underground chamber upon
another thoroughfare, pursuing which we came upon
an open, unused plot. Here a circus had attracted a
crowd. A three-year-old baby, a pretty little sister, a
feminine father, and a masculine mother were the entertainers.
They were acrobats. A family row&mdash;which, it
would seem, is not unknown in China&mdash;was enacted without
any of the details being omitted; nor did they stop
at coarse and vulgar acts which would have brought the
police down upon them in America. Yet the audience
seemed highly amused, while some of the spectators
might easily have posed for paintings of Chinese bearded
saints, or have been models for some of the sacred effigies
which, not more than a block away, were idols in
the temple.</p>

<p>These are the high spots in Chinese City, a city into
which I was urged not to venture alone. That human life
should be considered of little worth here is not marvelous;
but that any one there should consider the prolongation
of his own a bit worth the taking of mine, is
one of the inexplicable marvels of the world.</p>

<p>Is this China? By no means. It is merely the back-wash
of the contact with European life which has been
imposed on China without sufficient chance for its absorp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>tion.
It is no more typical of China than our metropolitan
slums are really typical of American life. True, they
are the result of it, but where the rounding out of relationships
and conditions have been accomplished there
follows a graduation of elements to where good and evil
obtain side by side. And Chinese City is but the worst
phase of Chinese slums plastered upon Shanghai.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>Poverty in Chinese City is one thing; in Shanghai
it is another. It is all a matter of the background.
Buddha the beggar is still Buddha the Prince.</p>

<p>After I came out of Chinese City I took much greater
note of the details of the life of the coolie, the toiler in
Shanghai proper. I was out on the Bund. The stone
walls hemming in the river Whang-po rise at a level
round the city. For five feet more the human wall of
coolies shuts out the tide of poverty and despair from
a world as foreign to China as water is alien to stone.
From both walls a murmur reaches the outer world: the
swish of the tide, the hum of coolie consolation. I let
myself believe that they chant beneath their burdens to
disguise their groans. Up and down the Bund they
course, here at exporting, there at importing. Their
gathering-places are at the godowns, and in and out
they pass up and down inclined planks, each with a sack,
or in couples with two or more sacks hanging from their
shoulders, never resting from these rounds.</p>

<p>At another point they are delivering mail to the ship's
launch. Two cart-loads arrive. Coolies swarm about
the carts, waiting for orders. Some are mere boys, but
already inured to the tread. As each lifts a bag of mail
he passes a Japanese, who hands him a stiletto-shaped
piece of wood with some inscription on it,&mdash;painted green
to the hilt. He takes two steps and is on the gang-plank,
two more, and he has burdened himself with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
three bags of mail, and returns; he received and returns
three sticks. That is the way count is kept of the mail.
I couldn't understand this close precaution. Could the
coolie possibly abscond with a bag of mail under the very
eyes of an officer?</p>

<p>Two small boys eagerly rushed a distance on, to pick
up some bags that had been left there. They were acting
without order,&mdash;spontaneously. They would have saved
themselves some labor in that way. But the officer in
charge shrieked his reprimand at them. One, in his
enthusiasm, ignored the command. The officer rushed
after him and boxed his ears. The boy received the
punishment, but went right ahead with his burden. Hardened
little sinner! calloused little soul! poor little ant!</p>

<p>One youngster came up, chanting the sale of some
sweet-cakes. Looking into his face, I wondered what
he was thinking just then. He must think! No one
could be so young and have such a cramped neck, such
sad eyes, such furrowed brows without hard thoughts
to make them so.</p>

<p>In the slush and rain, under semi-poverty and destitution,
barefoot, ragged, and in infinite numbers,&mdash;still they
toil. Yet against the background of sturdy Shanghai,
their labor and their travail does not hurt as much as
it does in Chinese City. The perplexities of life&mdash;national,
racial, of caste&mdash;pervaded my thoughts. Why
has China remained dormant so long? Why is she now
waking? How will she tackle the problem of poverty?
To me it seems that nations rise and fall not because
fluctuation is the inherent law of life, but simply because
universally accepted glory and prestige are positions
generally paid for by accompanying poverty and disease.
No nation can dominate for a long time with such coolieism
as that in China.</p>

<p>China has standards all her own. We come with our
ways and claim superiority. China grants it, yet goes
her own way. And when we see her sons we like them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
though we may criticize, condemn, and try to change
them. This is the oneness of China and the consensus
of opinion is that it is lovable. People come, employ
Chinese as servants, and try to train them. They may
take that which they think you do not need, carry out
their own and not your ideas. You in turn rave and
roar, but in the end they are still there as servants and
you as master. But they have educated you, you have
not changed them. And when you leave China you long
for them as did that American woman I met in Honolulu
who fairly wailed her longing aloud to me. China has
done this with whole nations, and, to the very end of
time, whatever nation sets out to rule and conquer that
new republic must make up its mind to be lost.</p>

<p>And so behind Shanghai is Chinese City, and behind
that there is China, out upon the flat plains. There is
another China yet beyond, and still another and as many
as there are billows on the sea. Build modern buildings
and cities, and the Chinese take them and turn them
inside out, and they are what he wants them to be. This
plastic people,&mdash;what is their destiny? And what, still,
is there awaiting the world as they fulfil that destiny?</p>

<p>How strange it feels to call her republic! Yet China
has taken to republicanism as though it had been brewing
in her these thousands of years. From outward
appearances one would never know that she is a republic
to-day. Some say she really isn't. Coolies still are
coolies, and Chinese, Chinese. And I dare say she is
both empire and republic, two in one.</p>

<p>For centuries China has lain dormant as though stung
by a paralyzing wasp. Centuries have been lost in sleep.
But what are centuries, when waking is so simple and
is always possible? China has wakened. She is rising.
An hour's work has been accomplished in the first fresh
flush of the new dawn. Perhaps that is all that will be
done that day, the house put in a little better order.
To-morrow is time enough for real work. A Chinese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
junk comes out of its night-mist retreat with its own dim
lights. A shrill whistle of a passing launch echoes across
the flat plains about Shanghai. The rain of yesterday
remains only as a sorry mist. A vision of clearer day
shimmers through, but soon grows dull again. China
seems to have shaped her climate in her own image.</p>

<p>A two-days' steam to Moji, Japan, on the bosom of
that heaving mistress the China Sea, and my journey
was over for a long while. The sea was black, the sky
somber; even the sun was sad as it stooped that evening
to kiss the cheek of Japan good night. I did not know
just then that I was to say farewell to the sea for two
and a half years,&mdash;a farewell that resulted in <i>Japan:
Real and Imaginary</i>.</p>

<p>I had gone out to the <i>Katori-maru</i> to inspect my
quarters. I always loved to get away from shore,
even if only in a launch or sampan; it was so much
cleaner and fresher on the bay. That afternoon it was
altogether too attractive out there, and the city of Kobe
lay so snugly below the hills that I decided to remain on
board till late in the evening, and missed the last launch.
I hailed a sampan. In this, with the wind splashing the
single sail and the spray scattering all about us, we
slipped romantically back to the American Hatoba. It
was my last entrance to Kobe.</p>

Japanese roofs may be monotonous&mdash;but never so is Fujiyama</p>


<p>All of the next day I kept changing trains and creeping
over Japanese hills and rice-fields in my devious and
indirect route to Yokohama by way of Japan's national
shrine, Yamada Ise. A few days later I was on board
the <i>Katori-maru</i>, the newest type of Japanese shrine,
the modern commercial floating shrine, named after one
of the most ancient of shrines in Japan. The Katori
shrine is said to have been founded some twenty-five
hundred years ago during the reign of the mythical first
emperor, Jimmu Tenno. It was dedicated to deities who
possessed great military skill and has always been patronized
mainly by soldiers. Transferring shrines from
land to sea is a hazardous procedure. For me, however, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
was ready to give my offering most willingly as long as
it brought me to Seattle. There were too many people
willing to patronize floating shrines at that time for me
to be too particular about deities.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">SEA, EARTH AND SKY<br />

All are one in this glorious Pacific World</p>

<p>For a moment, as we slipped away from the pier, I
felt what a dying man is said to feel when the flash-like
review of life's experiences course through his sinking
consciousness. I saw Japan and all its valleys, its dirt
and its sublimity; and with all its past confusions I
loved it.</p>

<p>Waiting for a final glimpse of Fuji left me idle enough
to observe the little things about me. There was, for
instance, the two-by-two-by-five sailor who was showing
two Japanese girls through the "shrine" he was serving.
I followed them about the ship. He was explaining
to them various mysteries.</p>

<p>The Sailor: "Kore wa otoko no bath. [This is the
men's bath.]" To the minds of these Japanese maidens
such a distinction was surprising.</p>

<p>The Sailor: "Kore wa second class. [This is second
class.]" This was like treading on sacred ground to
these lowly born mites.</p>

<p>The Sailor: "Kore wa kitsu en shitsu. [This is the
smoking-room.]" Why a special room for so simple
a service&mdash;and why men only?</p>

<p>He led them above to the hospital. He never made
any comments, they asked him no questions, but followed,
single file, as is proper for Japanese girls, agape with
curiosity. They passed the life-saving equipment. A
tiny voice ventured a question. An amazed member of
the Japanese Government (it was a government subsidized
vessel) said, with semi-scorn:</p>

<p>"Kore wa? <i>Boat.</i> [This? <i>Boat.</i>]" And they went
below.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>All of that forenoon, waiting for the <i>Katori-maru</i> to
slip away from the pier, I watched for Fujiyama, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
exquisite pyramid (to the summit of which I had climbed
twice), but it was veiled in mist. I wanted to see what it
looked like from the sea, just as I had seen what the sea
and the universe looked like from its peak. All afternoon,
as Japan was receding into the past, I tried to distinguish
old Fuji, but there was only a glittering edge, like a
sword, beneath the low, bright sun. After dinner I went
on deck and there in all that simple splendor which has
made it the wonder of the world, stood Fujiyama, with a
soft, sunset glow beneath its peak. The symbolic sword
had vanished. And I felt that in all those years and
miles and space which gather in my memory as that
single thing&mdash;the Pacific Ocean&mdash;nothing transcends in
loveliness the last view of Fuji from the sea.</p>

<p>Then for two days the world seemed to swoon in mist.
The fog-horn kept blowing drearily every two minutes;
yet the steamer never slackened its speed for a moment;
in fact, we made more miles those two days than during
the clear days that followed. We had taken the extreme
northern route and were soon in a cold latitude. The
fog became crisp, as though threatening to crystallize,
and when I stood on the forward deck it was almost like
being out in a blizzard. The siren continued to emit its
melancholy wail across a wilderness of waves lost in
mist. One could not see the length of the ship. At midnight
I woke, startled by the sudden cessation of the
propellers. For three hours we were stationary, owing
to engine trouble. The steamer barely rocked, giving
me the sensation of the deep as nothing ever did before.
It was at once weird and lovely, and in the darkness I
could imagine our vessel as lone and isolated, a thing lost
in an open wilderness of space. The siren continued
moaning like the wail of a child in the night, and once I
thought I heard another siren off in the distance. We
started off again and from then on didn't once slacken
our speed in the least, so large, so spacious, so unfrequented
is the Pacific in these days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>The fog hung close for so many days that a rumor
went round that the captain was unable to get his bearings.
With neither sun nor stars to rely on men's best
instruments are altogether inadequate. At half-past
nine o'clock one evening, however, the steel blinds were
closed over the port-holes. The ship began to pitch and
roll. The waves rushed at us and broke against the
iron cheek of the vessel. The fittings on deck rolled back
and forth, and those passengers unused to the sea clung
to their berths.</p>

<p>Only when we were within three days of the American
coast did the sun come out. For over a week we had
been in a dull-gray world which was becoming terribly
depressing. We were considerably farther north than
I had expected to be.</p>

<p>Five days after our departure, I was again at the
180th meridian, and enjoyed what only a very eager,
active person could enjoy,&mdash;a forty-eight-hour day. This
time, going eastward, we gained a day. I also had the
pleasure of being within fifty degrees of the north pole
just as three years before I had been within fifty degrees
of the south pole. In other words, I had touched two
points along the 180th meridian which were six thousand
miles away from each other, or twice the distance from
New York to San Francisco.</p>

<p>Calculations are somewhat misleading at times. For
instance, when we were near the Aleutian Islands, I
chanced to compare the records of that day's run as
posted in the first saloon with those posted in the second
saloon. The first read 4,240 miles from Yokohama; the
second, 4,235 miles. Japanese handling of figures made
the prow of the ship five miles nearer its destination
than the stern. Japanese historians also have a tendency
to make such innocent mistakes in their imperialistic
calculations. Japan's feet do not seem to be able
to keep pace with her desires.</p>

<p>As though to investigate this phenomenon, a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
bird,&mdash;slightly larger than a sparrow, with the same kind
of feathered back, but with a white breast, flitted down
upon the deck before me,&mdash;and began hopping about. It
approached to within two feet of me, then sneaked into
a warm place out of sight. A stowaway from birdland,
stealing a ride and planning, most likely, to enter
America without a passport. Perhaps it thought that
being near the stern of the boat, according to the calculations
above quoted, it could still remain beyond the
three-mile limit.</p>

<p>Then the homeward-bound spirit took possession of
me,&mdash;that selfsame realization of my direction which
had come over me upon sight of the Australian coast three
years previously, a psychological twisting which baffled
me for a time. Another day and we were within the
last square marked off by the latitudinal and longitudinal
lines,&mdash;the nearest I had been to America in nearly five
years. To remind me of my wanderings, the flags of
the nations hung in the dining-saloon: under nearly every
one of them I had at some time found hospitality.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>The reader who has followed me thus far has been with
me about three months on the sea. What to the Greeks
and the Romans was the Mediterranean, the Pacific will
be to us seventy times over. Already there is a wealth
of literature and of science which has come to us through
the inspiration of that great waterway. For Darwin
and Stevenson and O'Brien the Pacific has been mother
of their finest passions. In the near future, our argosies
will cross and recross those tens of thousands of miles
as numerously as those of the Ph&#339;nicians on the Mediterranean
in antiquity. They will bring us back the teas and
spices and silks of the Orient. But there are those of us
who have watched the "White Shadows" of the Pacific
who would wish that something were brought away be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>sides
the ephemeral materials. For there is in the sea
a kinship with the infinite and the absolute, and who
studies its moods comes nearer understanding life.</p>

<p>I wandered along one night with a New Zealand man,
without knowing where he was leading me. Suddenly
we came, by way of a narrow pathway, against a wall of
darkness. We were at the seashore. It was as though
we had come to the world's end and the white glistening
breakers arrived as messengers from eternity, warning
us against venturing farther. I strained my eyes to see
into that pitch-black gulch, but I might just as well have
shut my eyes and let the persistent breakers tell the
story of the sea in their own way. Afterward I often
made my way out to that beach and sat for hours, or
trod the sands till night left of the sea nothing but mournful
whisperings.</p>

<p>One day in August, when the first snow fell over our
little winter world in the far South, I had climbed the
hills up to the belt of wildwood that girds the city of
Dunedin. The very joy of life was in the air. Keenly
I sensed the larger season,&mdash;that of human kinship
merged in the centuries. I looked across the hills to
mountains I had known; but it was then not the Alps
I saw, not the Rockies, the Aeta Roa under the Southern
Cross, nor yet the Himalayas nor the snow-packed barriers
of the Uriankhai, the unrenowned Turgan group.
In truth, I was not seeing impassable peaks at all, but
imprisoned ranges which were themselves trying to outreach
their altitudinal limitations. It was a world consciousness
which was mine, and I towered far above the
highest peaks, above the world itself. I saw no single
group, no political sections nor geographical divisions,
the conquest of ridges, the commingling of noises, the
concord of peoples. And when men come to this world
consciousness they will recognize and accept all, include
the barrier and the plain. They will see these great,
sheer rugged peaks knifing the floating clouds, yielding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to the creeping glaciers, yet one and all, when released
sweeping down the valleys as impassioned rivers, filling
the lowest depths of earth, depths deeper than the sea,
lower than the deserts. In such moments of world consciousness
men will have to step downward from the bottom
of the sea and upward from the summit of McKinley.
Then barriers will become beacons. Mankind lives
at sea-level. We care little about our neighbors over
the ranges. That mental attitude makes barriers real
and valleys dark. But when we turn them into beacons
we shall climb the barriers in order to look into the
valleys of our neighbors and they will become the ladders
of heaven and the light unto nations. That is the lesson
of the sea.</p>

<p>At present we live at a sea-level, but beneath and behind
the barriers, are the peaks of earth. Hence walls of
houses are as great barriers as mountains. Hence even
thoughts are barriers and ideals become terrible, cold,
insurmountable prominences.</p>

<p>But in world consciousness, which is the lesson of the
sea, we do not reject anything,&mdash;the religions, the political
parties, the anti-religions, and the negations,&mdash;but we
bring them to the level of human understanding by
absorption, by taking them in. That is the story of
the sea.</p>

<p>The ocean breaks incessantly before us, but only the
one majestic wave thrills as it rises and overleaps the
rocky barrier. A forest is densely grown, yet only the
stately, beautiful tree stirs the forest-lover. The street
swarms with human beings all of whom are material for
the friend-maker, yet only one of the mass, in passing,
steeps the day's experience in the essence of love. But
loving that one wave, or tree, or being does not shut us
against the source of its becoming; rather does it teach
us the possibilities latent in the mass. That is the moral
of the sea.</p>

<p>But what is the sea? How can we know the sea? Is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
it water, space, depth? Can we measure it in miles, in
the days required to traverse it, in steamship lines, by
the turning of the screws, or by the system of the fourth
dimension? To me who have been round the greatest
sea on earth comes the realization that I have seen only
a narrow line of it, and that I can only believe that the
rest is what it has been said to be. Yet my faith is
founded on my knowledge of the faithfulness of the sea.</p>

<p>The sea, we sometimes say, has its moods, but rather
should they be called enthusiasms. It is really not the
sea at all to which we refer, but to something which in
the vague world of infinitude is in itself a sea whipping
the surface of an unfathomable wonder. The sea's
moods are not in its breakers, any more than is the surface
phenomenon which floors the region between our
atmosphere and ether, the story of our earth. We cannot
reach down beneath the breakers and learn the secret
of the heart of the sea. In ourselves, as in the sea, we
obtain a record of that tremendous silence which is the
harbinger of all sound, as the heavens are of all color.</p>

<p>One day in New Zealand I witnessed a conflict between
the earth and the sea. A tremendous wind swept north-westward,
and pressed heavily down upon the shore. It
sent the sand scurrying back into the sea. Even the
breakers, like the sand, fell back in furious spray like
the waves of sea-horses,&mdash;back into the ocean. The entire
length of the beach for three miles was alive with
retreating spray, mingled with the bewildered sand-legions
scurrying at my ankles.</p>

<p>One night, on the shores of Otago Harbor, the moon,
blasted and blunted by heavy clouds, had started on its
journey. In a little cave huddled a cloud of black night.
We had spread the faithful embers of our camp fire so
they could not touch one another, and wanting touch they
died in the darkness. We had put the curse of loneliness
upon each of them. The little cave had become only a
darker spot on a dark landscape,&mdash;a landscape so rough,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
so rare and rugged, reaching the sea and the western sky
of night. So rough, so unformed, so uncompleted. The
maker of lands was beating against it impatiently, rushing
it, forming it. What uncanny projections, what
sandy cliffs! For ages the wind and sea have been
whipping them into shape. Yet man could remove them
with a blast or two. For thousands of miles, all round
the rim of the great Pacific, the same process is going
on, day and night. While upon land, man has continued
working out his mission in the same persistent,
unconscious manner.</p>

<p>O Maker of lands' ends, O Sea, when will man be
formed? When will the conflicts among men cease?
They have tried to curb one another and to subject one
another to slavish uses, even and kempt. But still,
after ages of whipping and lashing, they are still unfinished
as though never to be formed. Are the various
little groups which lie so far apart, scattered by some
ancient camper, to die for want of the touch of comrade,
like those embers in the darkness of that empty
cavelet?</p>

<p>Here round the Pacific we dwell, each in his own little
hollow. May not this vast, generous ocean become the
great experiment station for human commonalty, for distinction
without extinction? The dreams that centered
in the other great seas&mdash;the Mediterranean, the Atlantic&mdash;were
only partially fulfilled. But here at the point
where East is West, it ought to be possible, because of
the very obvious differences, to maintain relations without
irritating encroachment. There was a time when passionate
desire justified a man taking a woman from another
with the aid of a club. To-day the decent man knows
that however much he may love, only mutual consent
makes relationship possible. And from the frenzy of untutored
souls let those who feel repugnance withdraw till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the force of a higher morality makes the rest of the world
follow in its wake.</p>

<small>EXIT THE NOBLE SAVAGE</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>To the primitive or simple races of the world marriage,
divorce, and supply of only the elemental
wants are the most intense problems. Nourishment and
reproduction make up the rounds of life. While the
highly developed nations around the Pacific are concerned
with the exploitation of the resources of the islands,
and with political problems growing out of their
reciprocal interests, the natives are struggling with matters
that lie nearer the real foundations of life. For
them the question of survival is an immediate and pressing
one. Extinction is facing many of them, absorption
by inflowing races is creating altogether new difficulties
and relationships, such as marriage and divorce, while
newer conceptions of exchange and trade, the buying and
selling of meats and vegetables, are introducing social
and moral factors they could not as yet be expected to understand.
Nor can we who have thrust ourselves upon
them or accepted responsibility for their well-being understand
our obligations unless we think of them as
human beings, or without visualizing their problems by
human examples. Nor can we escape these responsibilities
or shirk them. Out of the stuff their lives are made
of grow the larger problems, those of the relationship of
the great civilizations that touch each other on the Pacific&mdash;Asia,
Australasia, America.</p>

<p>Threnodies and elegies a-plenty have mourned the
passing of the Polynesians of the South Seas. The noble
savage whose average height often measured six feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>&mdash;plus
thick callouses&mdash;has stalked among us, as a mythical
figure, maidens unabashed in their naked loveliness
have lured men to the tropics oblivious of home ties.
Leisure and unlimited harems in prospect have afforded
many a civilized man salacious joys the like of which
the white race has not altogether abandoned, but which
few have the courage to pursue in the open. The passing
of these Pacific peoples has in some quarters been
hailed as an indication of the viciousness of civilization;
their yielding to virtue has been deplored by others.
The sentimentalist has clothed them in romance; the
cynic has stuck horns in their brows. But whether the
romancer is wrong or the missionary devoid of appreciation
of nature unadorned, the passing of the Polynesian
is an admitted danger. Whether it was the vice
of the drunken sailor or the clothes of the devout disciple
that brought about this downfall shall not here be determined.
It will be mine merely to depict in living examples
the episodes that indicate their evanescence, and to point
to the silent forces of regeneration that are at work,&mdash;forces
that, having accomplished the virtual decease of
some of the finest races in the world, and yet are bringing
about their rebirth.</p>

<p>One cannot live in the tropics without romancing.
The simplicity, the earnestness of life, devoid of many
of the outer signs of avarice so consonant with the individualism
of our civilization; the slovenliness unhampered
by too many clothes,&mdash;these take one by a storm of
pleasure. One forgets the natives once were cannibals;
or rather, one delights in saying to oneself "they
were," and forgets to thank the missionary and the
trader for having altered these tastes before one arrived;
one exalts every sprawling female into a symbol of
naturalness, though Heaven knows the soft white skins
and hidden bosoms of the North come as welcome
reminders in face of native temptations. And with
Professor Brown of New Zealand, one deplores that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
selfsame missionaries and traders "in spite of their antipodal
purposes and methods, alike force the race to
decay." Their contract with the white race is demoralizing
even where it aims to be most just and helpful. Their
lands, made secure to them by legislation (as in New Zealand),
often become the means of gratifying wild tastes
for motor-cars and fineries which leave them bankrupt
physically and morally.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>It was a steaming day. I had been up from before
dawn in order to make my pilgrimage to Vailima. Half
the morning was not yet gone when I returned to the
little hotel in Apia, situated beside the reefs, to hide
myself away from the burning sun. Even within the
shade of the upper veranda my flesh squirmed beneath
my shirt and the shoes upon my feet became unbearable.
So off went my shoes. Nothing merely romantic could
have induced me to crawl from under the shadows. There
I was content to listen to the lapping of the broken waves
as they washed shoreward over the reefs. There I
inhaled the scent of tropical vegetation as it reached me,
tempered and sifted to the satisfaction of one who dreads
the sun and its overweening brilliance.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wail lanced the silence. It sounded for all
the world like the melancholy "extra" which New York
newsboys cry through the side streets when they wish
to make a fire the concern of the world. I sprang up and,
leaning over the veranda rail, strained my neck in the
direction of the crier, who was still behind the bend in
the road which is Apia's Main Street. It seemed to
take him an unconscionable time to come into view, his
voice approaching and receding, and being battologized
as though by a hundred megaphones. Prancing, crouching,
and shading his eyes in the manner of an Amerindian
scout, he finally made his appearance,&mdash;a grotesque
fiend, one to strike terror to the heart of a god. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
oiled body glistened in the sun; his charcoal-blackened
jaw resembled that of a gorilla; while a scarlet turban
of cheese-cloth wound after the fashion of the Hindu
gave flaming finish to this frightful impersonation of the
devil. Nothing but the presence of the army of occupation
and the <i>Encounter</i> out in the harbor could have
allayed my apprehension, not even the vanity of racial
superiority or the oft-repeated prophecies about this
vanishing race. For he seemed savagery come to life.</p>

<p>Presently four others, similar personifications of deviltry,
came on behind him. In addition to make-up,
each brandished a long knife used for cutting sugar-cane,
or a clumsy ax. They squatted, they jumped, whirling
their weapons in heavy blows at imagined enemies. Never
was make-believe played with greater conviction, never
was the wish father to the act with more pathetic earnestness.
The pitcher of a chosen nine never hurled his ball
across an empty field with greater determination to win
the coming game than did these warless warriors wield
their weapons.</p>

<p>Slowly from the rear came the army, four abreast,
in stately procession. There were seventy-five Samoans,
each over six feet tall, men of girth and bone and pride.
Their glistening bodies reflected the sun like a heaving
sea. Their loins were draped in leaves in place of the
every-day sulu, with girdles of pink tissue paper round
them. Their faces, too, were blackened with charcoal,
and turbans of red cheese-cloth capped them. Those of
them who could not secure knives or axes, wielded sticks
with threatening realism.</p>

<p>In an instant I was in my shoes again and out upon the
road, a bit of flotsam in the wake of a great pageant.</p>

<p>I fell in with a Samoan policeman, dressed like an
English Bobby, trailing along in the rear. "What's the
trouble?" I asked. "Is this a preliminary uprising?"
There was much talk of the Germans stirring the natives
to rebellion against British occupation, but evidently the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
natives had had enough of alien squabbles, and it seemed
to matter little to them by which of the white invaders
they were ruled. A strange expression came into the
policeman's face, a mixture of awe and contempt. He
could speak only a very scant amount of English, but
enough to unlock this awe-inspiring secret. "Tamasese,
the king he dead," he said. I fumbled about in my memory
for coincidences. The policeman was old enough to
have been an understanding boy at the time Stevenson
took up the cause of Mataafa as opposed to the German
interests and antagonistic even to the British and American
attitude. It must have been strange to him, therefore,
to find himself a British policeman in a uniform of
blue, with a heavy helmet, timidly following a funeral
procession in honor of the son of a king disfavored of
Stevenson,&mdash;while all about were the soldiers of New Zealand.
I got nothing from him of any political significance,
but much in the way of the spirit of his race. For though
an officer of "the" law, perhaps the only one of his kind
in Samoa, he dared not go too close to the ranks of these
stalwarts. They had come from every islet of the Samoan
group, the pick of the race, representatives declaring before
the whole world: Our race is not dead; long live our
race!</p>

<p>So, all along the way for over a mile into the country
behind Apia, continued the procession. Not for a moment
did the antics cease; not for a moment did the wail
of the warriors subside. Every time the advance scouts
called out, "O-o-o-o-s-o-o-o" [The king is dead], the
four behind him thundered their denial, "E sa" [Long
live the king], and the entire regiment droned the confession
"O so." For the king was truly no more. Not
only the king but his kingdom. For not only was there
now no struggle of aliens over its precincts, but the
second conqueror, Britain, who once did not think Samoa
worthy as spoils, had stepped in and taken possession.</p>

<p>The procession filled the native population with awe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
No one ventured near. A dog ran across the road and
was immediately cut down by the sugar-cane knife in
a warrior's hand. A Chinese, with the contempt of the
fanatic for the fanaticism of others, drove his cart indifferently
into their line. Knives, axes, and other borrowed,
stolen, or improvised weapons found their way
into the chariot of the Celestial.</p>

<p>Half-way along, a limping old man whose leg was
swollen with elephantiasis advanced against them. He
challenged their approach. They cut the air with furious
blows aimed in his direction. He pretended to fall,
in the manner of a Russian dancer, picked himself up and
started on a wild retreat. The army had routed an
enemy.</p>

<p>Here the roadside spread in open land dotted everywhere
with native huts. Presently the army arrived
at the king's grounds, where a simple hut sat back about
two hundred feet from the road, with a bit of green
before it. The army broke "rank," and squatted in a
double row just at the side of the road. For a few minutes
there was silence.</p>

<p>Then out of the group rose Maii, the leader. Silently
he strode the full width of the space in front of the thirty
seated men, leaning lightly upon the long rough stick
in his hand. His giant-like figure was the personification
of dignity; his roughened face the acme of sobriety;
he seemed lost in thought. Facing about, he started to
retrace his steps in front of the seated men, then, as
though suddenly recollecting himself, turned his head
in the direction of the king's hut and in a subdued tone
no higher than that in ordinary conversation, addressed
the house of Tamasese, which stood fully half a block
away. Quietly, but not without emotion, he spoke and
paused; and every time he paused the leading four men
would shout "O-o-o-s-o-o," and the entire group would
answer "O sa." Convincing and convinced, the leader<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
proceeded with his oration. An hour later, to the minute,
he finished.</p>

<p>At the king's house appeared an old man in a snow-white
sulu, leaning heavily on a stick. I could see his
lips moving, but could not hear a word. He was speaking
to the leader, who could not hear any more than I.
They kept up the pretense at conversation for a few
minutes and all was agreed upon. A servant, who had
followed the old man with a soft mat in his hand which
to me looked like silk, advanced cautiously toward the
warriors.</p>

<p>Two of them jumped instantly to their feet, brandishing
their knife and ax furiously as though to protect the
leader or to drive away evil spirits, I knew not which.
But certain it was the cautious servant became still more
cautious, timidly arriving with his offering and presenting
it to the chief. The manner in which the gift was
accepted, though solemn enough, was full of admonition,
much as to say: "Now, don't you do that again." The
mat-bearer's heart seemed relieved of a great terror,
and he started back to the house of the king. On his
way he passed a mango-tree, stopped, looked up as
though he had spied an evil spirit, picked up a mango,
stepped back, and dramatically hurled it at the tree as
a boy would who was playing make-believe. At that the
whole army of stalwarts rose and departed to the right.</p>

<p>As soon as they left the grounds, eleven girls, in single
file, each with a mat of the loveliest texture imaginable
flung to the breeze, came out upon the road from the
other side of the grounds and followed round the front
to the right after the way of the warriors. And the
ceremony was over.</p>

<p>I had squatted on the ground, close to the warriors.
They treated me as though I were an innocent child who
did not know the dangers of evil things, nor enough to
respect my superiors. Not so the natives. Even the
policeman with whom I had arrived had retreated to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
protection of a hut some three hundred feet away from
the road. All the people in the neighborhood&mdash;men,
women and children&mdash;kept within their own huts, their
solemn faces full of awe and respect. Nor did the tension
slacken until the last of the maidens had made her
way out of sight.</p>

<p>Thus was the son of the last Samoan king escorted in
safety along the other way,&mdash;a way which to the native
mind seemed as vivid and real as heaven and hell were
to Dante and Swedenborg.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>Exit the Noble Savage. "Think," says Bancroft,
spokesman of the arrogant "Blond Beast," "what it
would mean to civilization if all these worthless primitives
were to pass away before us." The beginning of
this end was witnessed and told by Stevenson in 1892,
but the natives' version of it has yet to be related.
Against those who mourn his loss as the Hellenist the
Greeks, are some of our most practical men.</p>

<p>The Samoans are not vanishing as rapidly as are the
Hawaiians and the Maories, for two very simple reasons:
their climate is not so suitable to the white man as is
that of New Zealand and of Hawaii. Nor, like Fiji, has
Samoa been hampered by indentured coolieism, though
Chinese do come. Racially there seems no immediate
prospect of Samoa being submerged, though politically
it fell before Hawaii did. Socially, however, it is going,
as are the native features of most of the more progressive
and more assimilable peoples of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Simple naturalness is fast fading even from Samoa.
I do not mean to say that because Samoans are drifting
farther and farther from their primitive customs they
are losing their "charm." With progress, one expects
not oddity, but simplicity; not shiftlessness, but a certain
tightening up of the finer fibers of the race. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
satisfying to see the contrast between the loosely built
native hut and that whose pillars are set in concrete and
roofed with durable materials. But it is disheartening
when the change is only from thatch, which needs to be
replaced every so often, to corrugated iron, without any
other signs of durability. In other words, the corrugated
iron roof is no proof that the race is becoming more
thrifty, less lazy,&mdash;but the reverse. It indicates that
indolence has found an easier way, a more permanent
manner.</p>

<p>My presence at the ceremony in honor of the royal demise
gave me an opportunity to see at once some of the
best specimens of Samoan manhood. It left me with the
impression that no race capable of mustering so many
men of such build was on the decline. There was nothing
in their manner to indicate servility or despair.
And some day Setu, with his knowledge of Western
civilization gained at first hand, may be the means of
arousing his fellow-Samoans to great things.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>The process of assimilation and decline is taking place
with far more rapidity in Hawaii. Hawaii crashed like
a meteor into America and was comminuted and absorbed.
The finer dust of its primitive civilization is giving more
color to our atmosphere than any other American possession.
But the real Hawaii is rapidly receding into
the past. On the beach at Waikiki there is a thatch-roofed
hut, but like most of the Hawaiians themselves, it bears
too obviously the ear-marks of the West, the imprint of
invasion.</p>

<p>What there is left of the Hawaiians still possesses a
measure of strength and calmness. Big, burly, self-satisfied,
they wend their way unashamed of having been
conquered. Only a few thousand can now claim any
racial purity. The mixture of Hawaiians with the vari<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>ous
peoples now in occupation of their lands is growing
greater every year; those of pure Hawaiian blood, fewer.
And after all, is it any reflection upon any race that it has
been assimilated by its conquerors?</p>

<p>And assimilated to the point of extinction Hawaii has
been. It has become an integral part of a continental
nation of whose existence it had hardly known a hundred
years ago. When Captain Cook discovered Hawaii he
estimated its population at 400,000. Fifty years later
there were only 130,000. To-day there may not be more
than 30,000. The white race has had its revenge on
these natives for the death of this intrepid captain. And
the last of the great Hawaiian rulers, Queen Liliuokalani,
shorn of her power, passed away on November 11, 1917.
She, the descendant of great warriors and remarkable
political leaders, had turned to the only thing left her&mdash;expressing
the sentiments of her people in music.</p>

<p>The submersion is nearly complete. Politically, there
isn't a son among them who would feel any happier for
a revival. So little fear is there of such a hope ever
rising even for a moment in the Hawaiian breast that
the key to the former throne-room hangs indifferently
on a nail in the outer office of the present government. I
believe that that is the only throne-room under the
American flag. It is a small room, modern and finished
in every detail. On its walls hang paintings of kings
and queens and ministers of state. There is a musty
odor about it, which could easily be removed. All one
need do is open the windows and an inrush of sensuous
air would sweeten every corner of it. This would be
doing only what the race is doing with every intake of
alien blood.</p>

<p>A broad-shouldered, broad-nosed, broad-faced&mdash;and
seemingly broad-hearted&mdash;Hawaiian clerk took me into
the room. As we wandered about he told who the
worthies were, enframed in gilt and under glass. Interspersed
with some facts was inherited fancy. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
enthusiasm rose appreciably when he recited the deeds
of Kamehameha I, their most renowned king.</p>

<p>"Once he saw an enemy spy approach," said my
guide. "He threw his spear with such force that it penetrated
the trunk of the cocoa-palm behind which the
traitor was hiding, and pierced the man's heart." A
merry twinkle lit up the cicerone's eyes. That twinkle
was something almost foreign to the man: it must have
been the white blood in him that was mocking the tales
of his native ancestry.</p>

<p>Aside from these few portraits there was nothing in
the throne-room which gave evidence of Hawaii's former
prestige. Here that king's descendants planned to lead
his race to glory among nations. And here they were
outwitted. The guide had recounted among the king's
exploits his ability to break the back of his strongest
enemy with his naked hands. Yet the white man came
along and broke the Hawaiian back. And to-day he who
wishes to learn the habits, the arts, and the exploits of
these people has to go to the Bishop Museum in Honolulu.</p>

<p>A primer got up for children, to be learned parrot-like,
and distributed to tourists, tells us "the Hawaiians
never were savages." We are also assured they "never
were cannibals," and "speedily embraced religion." The
first is an obvious misstatement; the second is an apology
of uncertain value; as to the third, the son of one of
Hawaii's best missionaries, who just died in his
eighty-fifth year, said: "Not until the world shall learn
how to limit the quantity and how to improve the quality
of races will future ages see any renewal of such idyllic
life and charm as that of the ancient Polynesians." Dr.
Titus Munson Coan, whose father converted some fifteen
thousand Hawaiians to Christianity, deplored the effect
on the native of the high-handed suppression of native
taboos and attributes their extinction&mdash;which seems
inevitable&mdash;to the imposition of clothes which they put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
on and off according to whim, and to customs unsuited to
their natures. Dr. Coan said that though his father had
a powerful voice he remembered that often he could not
hear him preach because of the coughing and sneezing of
the natives.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, a visit to the Bishop Museum would
quickly contradict the primer. There the array of
weapons shows that the natives were not only barbarous
but savage. This is no serious condemnation, for none
of Europe's races can show any cleaner record. Arts,
indeed, the Hawaiians had, and sense of form and color.
An apron of feathers worn by the king required a
tax of a feather apiece on hundreds of birds. After
this feather was extracted, the bird was set free, an indication
of thrift if not kindliness. Yet they did not hesitate
to strip the flesh off every bone of Captain Cook
and distribute portions among the native chiefs. No one
has proved that they ate it; but cannibalism is, after all,
a relative vice and was not unknown in northwestern
Europe.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>The passing of the Hawaiians, like that of many other
races in the Pacific, is due to a cannibalism and a barbarism
which are less emphasized in the ordinary discussions
of the problem. There are more ways than one
of eating your neighbor. However harrowing that savage
diet was, it did not work for the destruction of any
of these South Sea islanders as ruthlessly as did the
practice among the Hawaiians of infanticide. Mothers
were in the habit of disposing of their impetuous children
by the simple method of burying them alive, frequently
under the very shelter of their roofs, lying down upon
the selfsame floor and sleeping the sleep of the just with
the tiny infant squirming in its grave beside them. Parents
were not allowed to have more than a given number
of children because of the strain on the available food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
supply. This more than anything else depleted the number
of natives most disastrously. But in addition came
the white man with his diseases, contagious and infectious,&mdash;a
form of destruction that, from the native point
of view, is quite as dastardly as eating the flesh of the
vanquished.</p>

<p>Certainly, whatever the viciousness of the occasional
or annual outbursts of passion among these primitive
folk, there was no example of regulated, insistent pandering
to vice such as has been set them by the Europeans,
especially in Hawaii. There one evening I wandered
through the very depths of degradation; there I witnessed
a process of fusion of races which had only one
possible end,&mdash;extinction. Its Hawaiian name had a
strange similarity to the word evil: it is <i>Iwilei</i>. McDuffie,
Chief of Detectives of Honolulu, was making his inspection
of medical certificates, which was part of the work
of "restriction," and took me with him.</p>

<p>Mr. McDuffie had been standing near the window of
the outer office, with one foot upon a chair, talking to
another detective, when I called out his name. Tall,
massive, with hair almost gray, a rather kindly face, he
looked me up and down without moving. I explained my
mission.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>A mean question, always asked by the white man in the
tropics. Well, now, who in thunder was I, anyway? I
murmured that I was a "writer." "Be round at seven-thirty,
and you can come along," he said dryly.</p>

<p>On his office walls hung hatchets, daggers, pistols, sabers,
and many other such toys of a barbarous world hacking
away against or toward perfection. On the floor were
dozens of opium pipes, taken in a raid upon Chinese
dens,&mdash;toys of another kind of world trying to forget its
progress away from barbarism. One Japanese continued
his game of cards nonchalantly. Flash-lights were in
evidence, fearlessly protruding from hip pockets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>At half-past seven I was there again. As we were
about to enter the motor-car, I ventured some remark,
thinking to make conversation. "Get in there," said the
chief, abruptly. For an instant he must have thought
he was taking a criminal to confinement.</p>

<p>Zigzagging our way through the streets and across
the river, we entered an unlighted thoroughfare, hardly
to be called a street. A steady stream of straggling
shadows moved along like spirits upon the banks of the
river Styx. Our way opened out upon a lighted section,
crowded with negro soldiers and civilians of all nationalities.
Here, then, and not only beyond the grave, class
and distinction and race dissolve. A perfect hubbub of
conversation, soda fountains and plain noise, and reeling
of drunkies. A futurist conception of confusion
would do it justice. We were at the gates of Babylon.</p>

<p>A closely boarded fence surrounded this city of dreadful
night. Hundreds of men crowded the passageway.
Within were rows and rows of shacks and cottages. Men
stood gazing in at open doors and windows. Outside
one shack a negro soldier remained fixed with his foot
upon the door-step, but ventured no farther. Within,
on a bed in full view, sat a Portuguese female, smoking,
an Hawaiian woman companion lounging beside her.
Both ignored the male at the door. But he remained,
silent. Hope fading from his mind, and some interest
elsewhere creeping in, he moved away. The Hawaiian
woman smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>Then for three-quarters of an hour we made strange
calls. Our card was a club which the assistant to the
detective&mdash;a massive Hawaiian&mdash;rapped on every porch
step, announcing the expected visitor. He was not unwelcome.
From every door emerged a woman, covered
with a light kimono, and neatly shod. At cottage after
cottage, door after door, they appeared, showed their
"health" certificates, and retreated. Japanese, Hawaiian,
white, brown, and yellow. Some extremely pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and not altogether unrefined in manner; some ugly and
coarse. The inspection was done hastily. Where
appearance of the inmate was delayed, a stamp of the
foot brought the tardy one scurrying out. Some greeted
the detective familiarly; others showed their certificates
and retreated. One Japanese woman called after us
when we had passed her door without stopping.</p>

<p>Wherever there was any transgression against the
proprieties, the inspector commanded the guilty to desist,
and went on. One woman complained that a negro had
just attacked her with a knife. She whistled and called,
she said, "But I might have been killed for all the assistance
I got." The inspector spoke kindly to her, assured
her he would order the guard to come round. But nothing
was done.</p>

<p>Two or three doors farther on a fat and playful woman
entertained a number of men who stood outside her
porch. The inspector told her to keep still. "Just such
remarks as that cause trouble. You get inside and stay
there." She shrugged her shoulders, made faces at him,
and danced playfully within-doors.</p>

<p>We came upon two groups of negroes, gambling. The
inspector slapped one of them upon the shoulder in a
kindly way and told them to get out of sight. "You
know it's not allowed here." They moved away.</p>

<p>It was a network of streets. Not an underworld but
a hinterland, a dark swamp-land, full of scum and squirming
creatures. A dreadful city, full of "joy" and abandon.
A city in which women are the monarchs, the
business factors, the independent, fearless beings, needing
no protection. Protection from what could they
need? Surely not from poverty, for wealth seemed to
favor these. From loss of reputation? They had no
reputations to lose. Protection they needed, but rather
from themselves than from outside dangers.</p>

<p>For this was a restricted district which harbored no
restrictions. This was the crater of human passion, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
animal passion. The well-ordered universe without;
within, the toils of voluptuousness. In this pit the lava
of lust kept stirring, the weight of unbalanced emotion
overturned within itself. The crater was thought to
be deep and secure against overflow. But if it did boil
over, was it far from the city?</p>

<p>In the city the sound of pianos playing, people reading,
swimming-pools full, streets crowded with racing automobiles,
soda fountains crowded, theaters agog, gathering
of folks in homes and caf&eacute;s,&mdash;a great world with
allotted places to keep men and women and children
happy; that is, away from themselves. A heavy curtain
of order protects one section. The most disgusting
polyandry shrieks from out the other. Yet no savage
community needed such an outlet for its emotions.</p>

<p>From various sources I learn that that little crater
has overflowed. The Chamber of Commerce, backed by
the missionaries and others, secured legislation against
the "regulation" of the district in 1917. From another
source I got it that it was not the forces for good that
banished it, but that two contending and competing
forces for evil had mutually eliminated themselves. But
still another source gives it out that certain "slum"
sections where housing facilities are inadequate are now
the center of evil, and that Filipino panderers are the
most guilty. And a year after <i>Iwilei</i> was "done away
with"&mdash;in April, 1918&mdash;the Chief of Detectives asked for
"thirty days" in which to show what he could do to
clean up the place so as to make it fit for the soldiers to
come to Honolulu.</p>

<p>Little wonder that, with such examples of "self-respect"
and shamefulness, lovers of the Hawaiians are
throwing themselves into the work of saving the few
remaining natives from demoralization. Before Cook's
time these people did not know what prostitution was.
Now they have lost hope and confidence in themselves.
The less pessimistic say that another hundred years will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
see the last of the Hawaiians, as we have seen the last
of the Tasmanians. Others fear it will come sooner. The
Hawaiian Protective Association is stimulating racial
pride in them so that they may take courage anew, and,
with what sturdy men and women there still are, rejuvenate
the race. But the odds are against them, for
besides disease and demoralization we have introduced
Japanese, Chinese, and all sorts of other coolies who
have completely undermined the Hawaiian status in the
islands, and are rapidly outnumbering them in the birth-rate
and survival rate. What factors are at work for
possible regeneration will be discussed in a later chapter.</p>

<h4>1</h4>

<p>Some of the gravest mistakes the white man has made
in his efforts to regenerate the Pacific peoples have
been indirect rather than direct. This fact is best illustrated
by the method Australia and New Zealand resorted
to in order to exterminate certain pests. To eliminate the
rabbit they introduced the ferret. The ferret then began
to reproduce so rapidly that it, too, soon became a
pest. So the cat was let loose upon the ferret. Forthwith
the cat ran wild and is now one of the most serious
problems in Australia.</p>

<p>So has it been in the matter of many of the native
races. Commercial greed, which was not satisfied to use
what native labor was extant because it is never the manner
of natives to be willing serfs to their conquerors,
looked everywhere about for people who might be imported
under crushing conditions and then cast out. It
was that which created the Japanese and Chinese situation
in Hawaii; and it is that which has created a similar
situation in Fiji.</p>

<p>One would have to be an unadulterated sentimentalist
to contend that the passing of the natives is not justified
by the present development of the Antipodes. None of
the native elements&mdash;the Australoids or the Tasmanians
or the Maories&mdash;would, of their own accord, even with
years of Caucasian example and precedent, have made
of these dominions the healthful, productive lands they
now are. As long as the problem remains one of the
ascendancy of the fittest over the fit, it is simple, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
present solution justifiable. But the introduction of other
races who have only their servility to recommend them is
a poor practice and soon turns into a more serious problem
still. In most cases, a little patience and foresight
would have obviated such contingencies. Had the white
folk who tried to exploit Hawaii contented themselves
with a slower development, the Hawaiians would to-day
be as secure as are the Samoans and the Maories.
In all cases such as these and that of the Philippines, the
native, when given a chance, soon justifies his existence
and our faith in him.</p>

<p>In Fiji we have an example of the introduction of the
Hindu to the extinction of the Fijian for the sake of the
enrichment of the white man. The indentured Indian,
small and wiry, who seems too delicate for any task and
is stopped by none, acts as a reinforcement in the South
Sea labor market. He glides along in purposeful indifference.
As coolie, he may be seen at any time wending
his way along Victoria Parade, bareheaded, a thin
sulu of colored gauze wound about his loins. As freed
man, he is the tailor, the jeweler, the grocer, and the
gardener. As proprietor he is buying up the lands and
becoming plantation-owner. Then he bewails the woes
of his native land, India, far off in the distance. Here
in Fiji, where the coolie has a chance to start life anew,
the longing for rebirth in this world, still fresh, bursts
into being. But no sooner does it see the sunlight than
it turns to crush the Fijian, in whose lands the Hindu is
as much of an invader as ever Briton was in India.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Indian into Fiji was not accomplished
without considerable protest from small
planters, who saw in it and the taxation scheme introduced
over thirty years ago, great danger to the Fijian laborer.
Aside from the burdens imposed upon the people
by a law which compelled them to work for their chiefs
without wages, for the same length of time that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
worked for some plantation-owner with wages, there was
the equally bad law being "experimented" with which
compelled the people to pay in kind instead of in money.
So serious had the situation become that the "Saturday
Review" of June 19, 1886, declared: "As the Natives
must eat something to live, it is perhaps not unnatural
that many people who know Fiji entertain distinct fears
that the combination of over-taxation and want of food
will drive the Fijians to return to cannibalism." The
charge of cannibalism was denied by the Rev. Mr.
Calvert, though further evidence is not at hand, as I have
seen only the Government's side of the case.</p>

<p>However, with the admission of some 3,800 Indians
as indentured laborers in 1884 (or thereabouts) among
a population of 115,000 natives, the vital statistics of
the islands have changed so that there were only 87,096
Fijians against 40,286 Indians in 1911, and 91,013 Fijians
against 61,153 Indians in 1917. This would seem to indicate
a healthier state of affairs for the Fijians as well
as for the Indians, were not the comparison of births with
deaths for the last year named taken into consideration.
This shows that to 3,267 births there were 2,583 deaths
among the Fijians; while among the Indians the births
were 2,196 as against only 588 deaths. This proportion
obtained also in 1911. The struggle between the Fijians
and the indentured Indians, even if the former were not
to become extinct within the century, would place the
Fijians in the minority in no time; and what were their
lands would be theirs no more.</p>

<p>This, briefly, is the story of the submersion of the
Fijians.</p>

<p>In itself, the situation is not very serious. What if the
Fijian passes, or gives way to the Indian? The contribution
of the Fijian to the culture or the romance
of the Pacific is small compared with that of other races,
such as the Samoans or the Marquesans. Of that more
anon. But there are problems involved that are of more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
immediate import. Two races like these cannot live together
without creating a situation of strength or of
weakness that is very far-reaching. We are concerned
with the attitude they assume toward each other, or in
the substitution of a race like the Indians, with their
fixed traditions and destructive castes, which will introduce
Hindu problems into the very heart of the Pacific.
India is no longer within bounds, and sooner or later we
shall be face to face with new conditions. In eliminating
the Fijian or the Hawaiian, or any other Pacific islander,
by the Indian or the Japanese coolie process, we are
only intensifying the difficulty, unless we are ready completely
to overlook the questions of likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>In Fiji one is not yet compelled to ask, "Where are the
Fijians?" As long as one's gaze is fixed slightly
upward, the Fijian face with the bushy head of coarse,
curly hair stands out against the green of the hills. But
let the eye fall earthward and the resultant confusion
of forms and manners forthwith raises the problem of
the survival of the fittest. For among these towering
negroids there now dwell over sixty thousand Telugus,
Madrasis, Sardars, Hindustanis, and a host of other such
strange-sounding peoples from India, and "Sahib"
greets one's ears more frequently than the native salutation.
In the smaller hotels the bushy head bows acknowledgment
of your commands; in the one fashionable
and Grand Hotel the turban does it. In the course
of the day's demands for casual service, the assistant is
the stalwart one; for the more permanent work&mdash;as,
for instance, the making of a pongee silk suit&mdash;the artisan
is the slender one. If your mood is for sight of sprawling
indolence, you wander along the little pier and open
places among the Fijians; if it is for the damp, cool,
darkly kind to help you visualize the dreams of the Ara<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>bian
Nights, you enter some little shop in an alley with
an unexpected curve, in the district of transplanted India.</p>

<p>Feeling venturesome, I let fancy be my guide, though,
to tell truth, I was escaping from the burning sun. Life
on the highway was alluring, but, large as the Fijian is,
his shadow is no protection. I hoped for some sight of
him within-doors. The row of shops which walls in the
highway, links without friction the various elements of
Suva's humanity. In a dirty little shop I ran into an
unusual medley of folk. A blind Indian woman in one
corner; a Fijian chatting with an Indian in another; a
boy whistling "Chin-chin"; boys and girls fooling with
one another; while in the little balcony, like a studio bedroom
hung in the deeper shadows of the rafters, slept
one whose snoring did not lend distinction to his paternity.
The place was evidently a saloon, but minus
all the glitter so requisite in colder regions. Here the
essential was dampness and coolness and improvised
night. Hence the walls had no windows and the floors
no boarding. Hence the brew had need of being cool
and cutting, regardless of its name; and whether one
called it <i>yagona</i>, <i>kava</i>, <i>buza</i> or beer, it had the effect of
making a dirty little dungeon in hiding not one whit
worse than the Grand Hotel in the beach breezes. Better
yet, where in all Fiji was fraternization more simple?</p>

<p>Still, too much love is not lost between the sleepy
Fijian dog and his Indian flea. Does the Fijian not hear
the white man&mdash;whom he respects, after a fashion&mdash;call
his slim competitor "coolie?" And is not <i>kuli</i> the word
with which he calls his dog? Infuriated, conscious of his
centuries of superiority, the Indian retorts with <i>jungli</i>,
and feels satisfied. His indentured dignity shall not
decay. At any rate, he knows and proves himself to be
the cleverer. The future is his. While the Fijian, seeing
that the importation the white man calls "dog" gets
on in life none the less, seeks to steep himself in the
Indian's immorality and trickery in the hope that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
may thereby acquire some of that shrewdness, as when
he devoured a valiant enemy he hoped to absorb that
enemy's strength. Thus in that dark little underworld
the Fijian Adonis vegetates in anticipation of the future
Fiji some day to spring into being.</p>

<p>Though the Indians are said to despise the Fijians, I
saw representatives of the two races sitting sociably together
upon the launch up the Rewa River, smoking and
chatting quite without any signs of friction. Indian
women, all dressed in colored-gauze raiment and laden
with trinkets, huddled behind their men. They seemed a
bit of India sublimated, cured of the ills of overcrowding.
One woman had twelve heavy silver bracelets on each
wrist, a number on her ankles, several necklaces and
chains around her neck, and many rings on each of her
fingers and toes, with ornaments hanging from her nose
and ears. But there was more than vanity in this, for,
pretty as she was, she refused to permit me to photograph
her. Not so the men. One Indian had his flutes
with him and began to play. His eyes rolled as he forced
out the monotonous tones, over and over again. His
heart and his soul must have had a hard time trying to
emerge simultaneously from these two tiny reeds. One
bearded patriarch smiled and rose with a jerk when I
asked if he would pose for me. A young Indian woman
crouched on the floor, all covered with her brilliantly colored
veil. She shared a cigarette with a Fijian boy in a
most Oriental fashion. But those who know distrust
this fraternization. It is the subtle demoralization of the
Fijian.</p>

<p>For the type of Indian men and women who now
accept the terms of indenture are even worse than those
who did so formerly, and the conditions under which
they are compelled to carry out their "contracts" are
such as to develop only the worst traits of Indian nature.
In consequence, the Fijian is being ground between the
upper (white) and nether (Indian coolie) mill-stones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
His primitive taboos which worked so well are taboos
no longer. The missionary has destroyed them well-meaningly;
the plantation-owner has preyed upon them
knowingly, has turned the predatory native chiefs upon
them; and now the riffraff of India is loose upon them,
too. I am convinced, from what I saw in the missionary
settlements, that had the missionaries alone been left
to lead these people away from barbarism, they would
have accomplished it,&mdash;as they partially have. But unfortunately,
the one weakness in their civilizing process,
the overestimation of minor conventions, such as the
wearing of clothing, only left an opening for the intake
of diseases and defects of our civilization. The insistence
on monogamy is another weakness, for to that the steady
decline of the native can be traced.</p>

<p>This dual process of degradation going on in Fiji is
a great disappointment to the adventurous. Though the
natives number 91,000, their ancient rites and festivities
are without newer expression, without newer form. And
though one hears much of Fiji as another India, because
nearly half the population is Indian, still, as C. F.
Andrews has pointed out, the utter absence of anything
Indian in the architecture, the religious practices, or the
other expressions of Indian ideals leaves one wondering
what is wrong with that newer world. Everywhere one
hears the appeal, "Give the man a chance," and democracy
and the advocates of self-determination for nations
repeat and repeat the plea. One believes that somehow
if India were partially depopulated and the remaining
Indians were given a chance, the soul which is India
would blossom with renewed life and glory. One believes
that here in Fiji such a miracle might occur. But
no promise of regeneration greets the seeker, go where
he may. Then, too, there is something lacking in the
native. One is led to conclude that the inhibitions upon
the mind and the soul of all the Fijians, through the
preaching of doctrines strange to them, or through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
practices of foreigners over them, has put the seal upon
their lips. Trying to approximate the ruling religions
and to live in their ways must create emotional complexes
in the natives that are clogging the wells of their beings.</p>

<p>From Suva for forty miles up the Rewa River, the
only manifestation of life is in labor. Aside from the
crude ornaments on the limbs of the women of India
there is virtually nothing of art or higher expression to
be seen. Nothing but the tropical loveliness, which cannot
be denied.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>The regeneration of the Fijian seemed more possible
after I had spent a few moments in the hut of the chief
of the district. In the middle of the village stood one
plain, unpainted wooden house, distinctive if not palatial.
It was altogether wanting in decoration and with us
might have passed as a respectable shed. But here, surrounded
by thatched huts, picturesque when not too closely
scrutinized, it assumed exceeding importance through
contrast.</p>

<p>The door, reached by a flight of four or five steps, stood
wide open. The interior was not partitioned into rooms.
Half of it was a raised platform-like divan or sleeping-section,
spread with native mats. Upon this elevation
sat a fine-looking man,&mdash;clean-shaven, with a head as
bald as those of his brethren are bushy, dressed in clean
and not inexpensive materials, and wearing a gold watch
on his left wrist. On my being introduced, he greeted
me in English so fluent and pure that I was considerably
taken aback. He was as self-possessed as most Fijians
are shy. This was Ratu Joni, Mandraiwiwi, chief of
eighty thousand Fijians, one of the only two native members
of the Legislative Council, highly respected, and
the most powerful living chief of his race.</p>

<p>He remained seated in native fashion, legs crossed
before him, and after a few general remarks indicated a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
desire to resume his confab with the half-dozen natives&mdash;all
big, powerful men&mdash;facing him on the lower section
of the chamber. His reception of me was cordial, yet
his was the reserve of a prime minister. His bearing
gave the impression of a man intelligent, calm, just, and
not without vision. He knew his rank. Had I been a
native and dared to cross his door-step&mdash;plebeian that
I am&mdash;I should most likely have seen dignity in anger.
But, though an insignificant white man, I still bore the
mark of "rank" sufficient to gain admission unceremoniously
and was given a place beside him on the divan.
But he had an uncanny way of making me feel suddenly
extremely shy. I was aware of intruding, of having been
presumptuous,&mdash;an uninvited guest. So I withdrew.</p>

<p>The district over which he rules, though inferior to
many another in productivity, has always had the reputation
for being well kept up and in healthful condition
and was pointed out as an example to the other
chiefs as early as 1885. At Bau, five miles the other
side of the river, Ratu Joni has a home European in
every detail. It forms an interesting background for his
European entertainments. His income is enough to make
a white man envious. One son, an Oxford man, was
wounded in Flanders at the outbreak of the war; another
was at the time attending college in Australia. Ratu
Joni is <i>Roko</i> (native governor) of the province of
Tailevu (Greater Fiji).</p>

<p>Mr. Waterhouse, the missionary who kindly went about
with me and made it possible for me to meet this chief
and to understand some of the native problems, gave me
a brief story of this impressive man's life. Though his
father had been hanged or strangled for plotting against
the life of the chief who ruled then, Ratu Joni succeeded
in making his way to the fore in Fijian politics. He set
himself the task of cleaning up his country. Of him it
could not be said that he ever had reason to be ashamed
of his rule. Of him none could say as did a British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
governor in a speech say of another Fijian: "What! has
this chief been indolent? Perhaps he limes his head,
paints his face, and stalks about, thinking only of himself;
or is it that he squabbles with his neighbors about
some border town, and lets his people starve?"</p>

<p>One cannot judge a people by the conditions of its
chiefs or rulers; but with regard to the natives of the
Pacific, as in the case of other people accustomed to the
rigorous life of battle, their safety lies in the uses to
which they have been put by their conquerors. The
British Government has utilized the Sikhs, its most difficult
Indians, by making them the constabulary throughout
the length and breadth of its Asiatic empire. This
has been done in Fiji, too. But the most hopeful sign
to me in these islands on the 180th meridian was the
Fijian constabulary. A finer lot of men could not be
found anywhere in the world. Not only their physique
but their intelligent faces and their alacrity suggest great
promise. One of them came on board our ship with his
clean, tidy, sturdy wife&mdash;a public companionship rare for
these people&mdash;and was received by the officers. His white
sulu, serrated on the edge like some of the latest fashions
on Broadway, hung only to his knees. His massive legs
and broad shoulders were a delight to look upon. His
wife was as handsome a woman as I have seen in the
tropics. The two gladly posed for me, and asked me to
send them a print.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>Generally the thought and feeling of the natives in
the South Seas come to the outer world through the works
of white men,&mdash;missionaries and scientists. But rare
indeed is the revelation of the mind of a strange people
brought to us pure and clear without the white man's bias
or reaction. Here and there I have run across snatches of
native thinking that were revelations, but no others so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
full and vivid as the essay by a native Fijian on the decline
of his race, which appeared in the "Hibbert Journal"
(Volume XI). The translator opens the door to the
Fijian mind as by magic. After reading that, I felt that
personal contact with these natives akin to contact with
any other human being, for I looked behind dark skin
and bushy head, and saw the spirit of hope within. The
translator says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It shows exactly how an intelligent Fijian may conceive Christianity.
That is a point we need to know badly, for most missionaries see the
bare surface. It also contains hints how the best intentions of a government
may be misconstrued, and suspicion engendered on one side,
impatience and reproaches of ingratitude on the other, which a more
intimate knowledge of native thought might remove.</p></div>

<p>The argument of the essay is that "The decline of native
population is due to our abandoning the native
deities, who are God's deputies in earthly matters. God
is concerned only with matters spiritual and will not
harken to our prayers for earthly benefits. A return
to our native deities is our only salvation."</p>

<p>The native reflects:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Concerning this great matter, to wit the continual decline of us
natives at this time, it is a great and weighty matter. For my part
I am ill at ease on that account; I eat ill and sleep ill through my
continual pondering of this matter day after day. Three full months
has my soul been tossed about as I pondered this great matter, and in
those three months there were three nights when pondering of this
matter in my bed lasted even till day, and something then emerged in
my mind, and these my reflections touch upon religion and touch upon
the law, and the things that my mind saw stand here written below.</p></div>

<p>He then takes up the points that have disturbed him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, if the very first thing that lived in the world is Adam, whence
did he come, he who came to tell Eve to eat the fruit? From this
fact it is plain that there is a Prince whom God created first to be
Prince of the World, perchance it is he who is called the Vu God
[Noble Vu].... Consider this: It is written in the Bible that there
were only two children of Adam, to wit Cain and Abel. But whence
did the woman come who was Cain's wife?...</p>

<p>It seems to me as though the introducers of Christianity were slightly
wrong in so far as they have turned into devils the Vu Gods of the
various parts of Fiji; and since the Vu Gods have suddenly been
abandoned in Fiji, it is as though we changed the decision of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Great God, Jehovah, since that very Vu God is a great leader of the
Fijians. That is why it seems to me a possible cause for the Decline
of Population lies in the rule of the Church henceforth to treat altogether
as devil work the ghosts and the manner of worshiping the
Vu Gods of the Fijians, who are their leaders in the life in the flesh,
whom the Great God gave, and chose, and sent hither to be man's
leader. But now that the Vu Gods whom Jehovah gave us have been
to a certain extent rudely set aside, and we go to pray directly to the
God of Spirit for things concerning the flesh [life in the flesh], it
appears as if the leader of men resents it and he sets himself to crush
our little children and women with child. Consider this:</p>

<p>If you have a daughter, and she loves a youth and is loved of him,
and you dislike this match, but in the end they none the less follow
their mutual love and elope forthwith and go to be married, how is it
generally with the first and the second child of such a union, does it
live or does it die? The children of Fijians so married are as a rule
already smitten from their mother's womb. Wherefore? Does the
woman's father make witchcraft? No. Why then does the child die
thus?</p>

<p>Simply that your Vu sees your anger and carries out his crushing
even in its mother's womb; that is the only reason of the child's death.
Or what do you think in the matter? Is it by the power of the devil
that such wonders are wrought? No, that is only the power that
originates from the God of Spirit, who has granted to the Prince of
men, Vu God, that his will and his power should come to pass in the
earthly life.</p></div>

<p>He develops this theme with ever-increasing emotion,
until his poor mind can think no more.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Alas! Fiji! Alas! Fiji is gone astray, and the road to the salvation
of its people is obstructed by the laws of the Church and the
State. Alas! you, our countrymen, if perchance you know, or have
found the path which my thoughts have explored and join exertions
to attain it, then will Fiji increase.</p></div>

<p>But Fijians have prayed to God, yet they have not
increased, he exclaims, faced with the unalterable facts.
Why not? Christianity has been with them many years.
Does God hear their prayer! He proceeds to give his
own observations of life, and asks: "Is this true, reverend
sirs? Yes, it is most true." After making some
comparisons between his land and others, neglected of
God in that they have no Vu Gods, he expostulates:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And if the Vu were placed at our head ... there would be no
still births and Fiji would then be indeed a people increasing rapidly,
since our conforming to our native customs would combine with progress
in cleanly living at the present time. Now, in the past when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
ancients only worshiped Vu Gods and there was no commandment
about cleanly living, yet they kept increasing. Then if ... this were
also combined with the precept of cleanly living, I think the villages
would then be full of men. Or what, sir, is your conclusion?</p></div>

<p>A few more excerpts, taken here and there, will reveal
the interesting mind of this Fijian:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If this is right, then it is plain how far removed we are from certain
big countries. How wretched they are and weak, whose medicines are
constantly being imported and brought here in bottles.<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As for me, I
simply do my duty in saying what appears in my mind when I think
of my country and my friends who are its inhabitants; for since it
wants only a few years to the extinction of the people it is right that
I reveal what has appeared in my soul, for it may be God's will to
reveal in my soul this matter. Now it is not expedient for me to
suppress what has been revealed to me, and if I do not declare what
has appeared from forth my soul, I have sinned thereby in the eyes
of the Spirit God: I shall be questioned regarding it on the day of
judgment of souls; nor is it fitting that one of the missionaries should
be angry with me by reason of my words; it is right that they should
consider everything that I have here said, and judge accordingly. It
is no use being ashamed to change the rules of the Church, if the
country and its inhabitants will thereby be saved.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_4" id="Footnote_1_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_4"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The translator says in a footnote: "Whites pity Fijians, but they find
reasons to pity us. That is what white men generally fail to realize; they
put down to laziness or stupidity their reluctance to assimilate our civilization,
whereas it arises from a different point of view; and that point of
view is not always wrong or devoid of common sense. Is Fijian medicine
more absurd than our patent medicines, or as expensive?"</p></div>

<p>There is great hope for a people with such thinkers
among them. And if there are such hopes for the
Fijians, there are still greater possibilities for the
Maories, Samoans, Tahitians, and Hawaiians.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>Politically, as separate island races, they are no more.
The little Kingdom of Rarotonga is one of the last to
remain independent. The European war, oddly enough,
in which Maories and Fijians fought for "the rights of
little nations," has sold them out completely, just as
it did Shantung in China. No one thought that a war
in a continent fifteen thousand miles away would play
such havoc with the destinies of these people. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
"mandates," yielded with such cynical generosity, put
the seal upon their fate, and opened new international
sores.</p>

<p>Pessimistic as this may sound, there are evidences of
resuscitation in the working out of these mandates, as
will appear in the chapter on Australasia. The Polynesians
are becoming conscious of unity, and talk of leadership
under the New Zealand mandate is rife in Parliament.
"Nothing would hasten the depletion of the race
more than the loss of hope and confidence in themselves,"
says the Hawaiian "Friend." That hope seems to be
flickering into new life.</p>

<p>No people have suffered more, directly, from contact
with the "civilized" white races than the Polynesians.
Morally undermined, politically deprived of powers,
physically subjected to scourge after scourge of epidemic
introduced by white men, their own standards of living
brushed aside as vulgar and infantile,&mdash;these heliolithic
people with their neolithic culture approached the very
verge of extinction. Then the white race began to sentimentalize
over them, and sincere scientific people to
deplore their evanescence. Some of these latter have
earned the eternal gratitude not only of the natives but
of the whole world. Some of them I have mentioned in
other connections. Two others decidedly deserve recognition.
Mr. Elsdon Best, the curator of the Wellington
Museum, is a tall, thin individual who has roamed all
over the Pacific. He has worked his way for years in the
interests of the Amerindians, Hawaiians, and Maories.
Now he has one of the finest museums in the South Seas&mdash;excepting
that, of course, in Honolulu&mdash;in which he
treasures anything and everything that will help throw
light on the history of these interesting people. The
other is Mrs. Bernice Bishop, a part-Hawaiian woman,
who established the museum in Honolulu which bears
her name. These are the centers round which we white
folk shall be able to gather for the preservation of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
other type of the human species. In the summer of 1921
a Scientific Congress under the auspices of the Pan-Pacific
Union and the immediate directorship of Professor
Gregory of Yale was held to devise ways and
means of furthering the study of these races, and its
work is proceeding apace.</p>

<p>Museums and "models" of native architecture are the
modern white man's diaries, recalling the acts of ravishment
and destruction which his development and expansion
entailed. Let us hope that out of the efforts of
scientists will spring a new consciousness of worth, which
early missionaries and scheming traders did everything
to destroy. Yet it must not be forgotten that much of
our knowledge of these races comes from those missionaries
who were broad-minded enough to recognize the
value of recording customs and beliefs, even if their purpose
was the more effectively to counteract them.</p>

<small>HIS TATTOOED WIFE</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>Something there is in the very bearing of the people
in the Pacific which, despite the obvious differences
between us, strikes a note of kinship in the mind
of the white man least conscious of his true relationship
to these brown folk. A certain chemical affinity, as it
were, makes the problem of intermarriage with the Polynesians
an altogether different matter from that among
Eurasians. For in the marriage of an Occidental and a
true Oriental there is the clashing of two antagonistic
cultures each equally complex and tenacious, while "here
there is evidence in the physique of the people that three
great divisions of mankind have intermixed."</p>

<p>But in the Pacific islands the white man feels himself
among his kind. The reason is hard to explain. Certainly
it is not the loose and ungainly Mother-Hubbard
gowns which are still the style of the native maiden. Yet
the stoutish, portly individual who is introduced to you
as a chief and who parades the street along the waterfront
in a suit of silk pajamas might easily be a continental
sleep-walker who has no remembrance of the
thousands of years that lie between him and the men
among whom he is waking. And the white man just arrived
drops off under the an&aelig;sthetic influence of the
tropics, forgetful of the thousands of years in which he
has been busy laying up his treasures on earth.</p>

<p>Under this narcotic influence I wandered along the
shores of Apia, Samoa, toward sundown, the day before
my departure. Within me was a melancholy satisfaction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
an unwillingness to admit even to myself the truth that
I was glad to go, like one conscious of being cured of a
delightful vice. I had had my fill of association with
men whose main theme of conversation when together
was the virtues of whisky and soda as an antidote for
dengue fever, and when apart, the faults of one another.
I had watched the process of acclimatization as it attacks
the souls of men, and pitied some of them. Many would
have scorned my pity. Some did not deserve it. Others
did not need it. The story of one is worth while, though
it has no solution.</p>

<p>He had been stationed in Samoa as a member of the
military staff with police duties. Behind him he had
left a wife and kiddies. He longed for them as only a
man struggling against tropic odds to remain faithful to
his promise needs must long. He was faithful, but she
was fearful. She was writing to him daily not to forget.
No woman forgets easily the ill-repute of her fellow-women,
and all Northern women distrust their sisters of
the warmer worlds. Women hear and believe that there
is none of their kind of virtue in the tropics, and they
do not trust the best of their men. They do not seem
to be at all aware of the fact that faithfulness and devotion
are as strong impulses in the breasts of the dark
maidens as among themselves, and that semi-savage
girls have hearts, too, which can be broken. So this
man whose friendship I had won urged that I write to
his wife and, in my own way, assure her of his loyalty.
I have never heard the end. But if ever she reads this
account, I hope she will believe in him.</p>

<p>For there are women in the tropics, just like her, who
pray that their men will be faithful. I was walking
along, thinking of him and of her. The evening glow,
full to overflowing of tropic loveliness, was all about.
The white foam of the breakers dashing themselves
against the reefs out there, a quarter of a mile away,
came softly in, over the smooth water, to land. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
laughter of little children on the beach seemed to tease,
the hiss of the sea, a combination of elemental things
utterly without tragedy.</p>

<p>Just then I came upon a group of people gathered at
the little pier. Strewn about their feet were trunks and
bags and kits, indicating departure in haste, while the
presence of a handful of soldiers, standing at attention,
was an unspoken explanation of what was toward. The
civilians clustered in a little group, quiet, communicating
with one another in whispers. They comprised seventeen
Germans, erstwhile the wealthiest plantation-owners,
now prisoners of war, and their wives and children,
from whom they were to be parted. The cause of
their departure is not pertinent here. The human equation
is.</p>

<p>As the officer issued his order for embarkation, there
was a momentary commotion. Soldiers, by no means unfriendly
to their prisoners, assisted them in the placing
of luggage on the boat. The men, turning to their women
and children with warm embraces, called in forced cheerfulness
that they would soon be back. All the men
stepped into the rowboats and with full, powerful strokes
of Samoan oarsmen they were borne out across the reefs
toward the steamer anchored beyond. Upon the beach
remained bewildered native women and their half-caste
children, some of them in an agony of grief now run
wild. One family lingered, weeping silently. A group
of two middle-aged women, a girl of about twenty, two
small girls, and two boys stood gazing out toward the
ship. They brushed away tears absent-mindedly. A
little girl and boy cried quietly. And like that white wife
in the temperate world, these dark-skinned women of the
tropics were left to wonder whether their husbands would
remain faithful to them in a world of which they had
vague if not altogether wrong notions.</p>

<p>A full, mellow afterglow threw the ship for a moment
into relief, and twilight lowered. Upon the end pile of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the pier sat a young Samoan in a halo of dim light.
From this modern scene which may some day be the
theme for a South Sea "Evangeline" I moved away wondering
what this cleavage of people would mean to the
Polynesians. An unconscious curiosity led me into the
village. It was night. From the various huts rang the
voices of happy natives. Fires flamed under their evening
meals. Dim lamps revealed shadow-figures of men
and women. A slight drizzle brushed over the valley
and disappeared. Then the firm tread of feet sounded
in the dusty road. About twenty girls, two abreast,
stamping their naked feet, passed by and on into the
darkness to drop, matrice-like, each into her own home.
Earlier that evening they had escorted to the ship
the white woman who was their missionary teacher.
One long skiff had held them all. Each had a single oar
in hand, short and spear-headed, with which she struck
the gunwale of the boat after every stroke, thus beating
time to a native song. Here was another case of contact
and cleavage. Their teacher was returning to her land,
leaving them with the glimmer of her ideals, her notions
of life and loyalty. How much of it would hold them?
Coming and going, the fusion of races, once of a common
stock, is taking place.</p>

<p>I cannot recall having received any definite invitation
from any of the principals responsible for the party I
attended one evening in Apia, but in the islands the respectable
stranger does not find himself lonely. It was
sufficient that I was a friend of one of the guests. Four
young men who were leaving were given a send-off; and
the celebrations were to take place in the little Sunday-school
shack.</p>

<p>That evening the little structure was metamorphosed
from crude solemnity by a generous trimming in palm
branches and flowers, as though it had been turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
outside in. Oil-lamps hung from the rafters by stiff wires,
unyielding even to the weight of the light-giving vessels.
The awkwardness of some of the natives in their relations
with the whites could not be overcome even by their
obvious inclination. But the music stirred us all into
a whirl of equality. It was furnished by an old crone
of a native woman. She was dressed in a shabby Mother-Hubbard
gown and her feet were bare. Her stiff fingers
worked upon the keys of an accordion in a sluggish
fashion, as she confused old-fashioned barn-dances with
sentimental melodies. She was stirred on to greater
sentiment by the teasing approaches of one white man
fully three-quarters drunk. As for the dancers,&mdash;what
to them were half-expressed notes? Their own fresh
blood more than overcame any lack.</p>

<p>Pretty young flappers, eager for the arms of the
white chaps, moved about among stolid dames whose
purity of race revealed itself in russet skins and slightly
flattened noses. They had finer features than the matrons.
The white "impurities" shone out of them. But
they were not quite free, not quite absolved from the
weight of their primitive forebears. They were shy and
had little to say for themselves, and it seemed they
wished they could just cast off the high-heeled shoes and
tight garments and be that which at least half of themselves
wished to be. Yet they were erect and proud,&mdash;and
gay.</p>

<p>Behind the curtain which hung across the little rostrum
stood tables fairly littered with bananas, mangos,
and watermelons, mingled with the fruits of the Northern
kitchen stove,&mdash;cakes, pies, and meats enough to satisfy
a harvesting-gang. And when the call to supper
came, the invasion of this hidden treasure island and its
despoliation proved that however much mankind may be
differentiated socially and intellectually, gastronomically
there is universal equality.</p>

<p>There is another basis upon which the wide world is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
one, and that is in its affections. Long after midnight
the party would have still been in progress but for the
threat of the ferry-men. They wished to retire and announced
that the last boat was soon to start across the
moon-splattered reefs. There was a hurried meeting
of lips in farewell. The silver light revealed more than
one sweet face crumpled before separation. Then with
the first dip of their oars into the sea the swarthy oarsmen
began the song which, exotic and sentimental as
it was, left every heart as aching for the shore as it did
those of the simple half-caste maidens for their casual
lovers of the colder Antipodes.</p>

<p>"Oh, I neva wi' fo-ge-et chu," drawled the oarsmen,
and they on shore joined in with the softer voices of
that gentler world.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>I had been an unknown and unknowing guest, paying
my rates for keep at the hotel. For most of an hour I
had been in a small upper room with three or four white
men whose sole object seemed to be to get as drunk as
they could and to induce me to join them. In those clear
moments that flash across leary hours, they gave voice
to their disapproval of intermarriage with the natives.
Then I learned of the wedding taking place below. My
curiosity led me downstairs, and though an utter
stranger, I made my way into the company. Not for a
moment did I feel myself out of place. Such is the nature
of life in the tropics. Among those present were
pretty half-caste maidens, slovenly full-blooded native
matrons, men and women of all ages and conditions of
attire. There were German-Samoans, English, English-Samoans,
American and American-Samoans, with a
salting of no (or forgotten) nationality. Some were in
Mother-Hubbard gowns, some in pongee silks, some in
canvas and white duck, cut either for street or evening
wear. One young chap, the clerk at the customs, came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
dressed in the latest tuxedo. And a half-caste chief
appeared in a suit of silk pajamas.</p>

<p>The marriage-feast was as sumptuous as any that ever
tempted the palate of man. It was spread not on acres,
as in the olden days, but on a long table which stretched
the length of the thirty-foot room. Photographs are
everywhere sold displaying so-called cannibal feasts,
with huge turtles and hundreds of tropical vegetables.
However it may have been in those days, at this feast
the guests were cannibal in manners only. They stood
round the table and helped themselves with that disregard
of to-morrow's headache and the hunger of the day
after which is said to be primitive lack of economy.</p>

<p>As the guests were led out into the dance-hall, one
young stalwart took the remnant of the watermelon rind
he had been gnawing and slung it straight at the pretty
back of a Euro-Polynesian girl in evening frock. She
tittered at him. The jollity was running too high for
any one to be disturbed by anything like that.</p>

<p>Soon the dance was in full swing. Not the tango, which
we regard as primitive and wild, but sober editions of
dances with us long out of date. The need is more pressing
in the tropics among folk of part-white parentage
than an appearance of real civilization. And though it
is not so long in the history of the Pacific since the coming
of the first white man, there is already an intermediate
race growing up which, beginning with Samoa,
spreads northward and southward and all around as far
as the reaches of the sea. Nor is the mixture always to
be deprecated.</p>

<p>The night wore on. The dancing ceased. Flushed
faces and perspiring forms slipped out into the moonlight.
The white collar which had adorned the tuxedo of
the clerk was now brother to the pajamas. The white
men who had tried to drown their objections to intermarriage
had yielded to the lure of the pretty half-caste
maidens. One of them now disappeared with his "tart."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>A traveling-salesman from Suva, thin and wiry, had
been in dispute with a new civil officer. They contradicted
each other just to be contrary. The officer had
a wife at home to whom he was bound to be faithful in
matters of sex; in the matter of spirits he could not be
unfaithful, since in that all the world is one. When the
two of them and I left the party, they were still disputing
the question of intermarriage, in which neither believed
but on which both had pronounced complexes.</p>

<p>To change the subject, which was bordering on a fight,
I asked: "Why do the palms bend out toward the sea?"</p>

<p>"Now, what difference does it make to you?" said the
salesman. "You're always asking why this, why that?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he?" grumbled the officer, more
sober and more intelligent.</p>

<p>We rambled along. The salesman soon slipped into
his hotel. The officer and I wandered toward the native
village.</p>

<p>"Strange," he said, somewhat sobered by the sea air.
"If I met him in Auckland I wouldn't speak to him.
He's beneath me."</p>

<p>Free and easy as the relationship of marriage seems
to be here, one not infrequently runs across descendants
of very happy and desirable unions. I had gone on a
little motor jaunt with some of the men of the British
Club. Our way was along the road the natives had built
in gratitude to R. L. S., and our destination the home of
a friend of his, who had married a native woman. The
house was of European construction, solid and comfortable,
with a veranda affording a view of the open sea.
The interior was in every way as typical of British colonial
life as any I later saw in New Zealand. There
were photographs on the wall, hanging shelves, bric-&aacute;-brac,
a piano,&mdash;all importations of crude Western
manufactories.</p>

<p>The hosts were Euro-Polynesians; the father a lawyer
and son of a clergyman of Sydney, Australia, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
settled in the islands years ago. I do not recall whether,
like his closest friend, Stevenson, he was buried on the
island, but certainly he left by no means unworthy offspring,
whatever prejudice may say.</p>

<p>Thus, in the mixture of emotions often sterile, and in
the bones of white devotees is the reunion of the races
of these regions being slowly effected. And at the two
extremities of the Pacific&mdash;New Zealand and Hawaii&mdash;we
find the process nearer completion.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>In the journeys to and fro across the vast spaces
of the South Pacific one rarely meets a white man who
takes his native wife with him. One such I did meet
when slipping down from Hawaii to the Fiji Islands.
There were two couples on board who always kept more
or less to themselves, two rough-looking white men, a
white woman, and one who for all I could tell was a middle-class
Southern European woman. She wore simple
clothes,&mdash;a blouse hanging over her skirt and comfortable
shoes. She was in no sense shy, laughed heartily,
moved about with a self-conscious air of importance,
but with ease, and made no effort to hide the curving
blue lines of tattooing that decorated her chin. She was
a Maori princess, and all the vigor of her race disported
itself in the supple lines of her figure.</p>

<p>Her husband, Mr. Webb, however, was not a British
prince. Blunt in his manners, he was ultra-radical in
his opinions,&mdash;a proud member of New Zealand's working
class. Domineering in his temperament he was, but
she was a match for him. It was obvious that she had
missed in her native training any lessons in subservience
to a mere husband. She spoke a clear, broad, fluent
English without the slightest accent, and when her extremely
argumentative husband made a strong point,
she gave her assent in no mistaken terms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>At table she was more mannerly than her spouse,
though laboring under no difficulties whatever in the acquisition
of food. I have never seen a person more self-possessed.
Her royal lineage was writ large in her
every expression. Though out on deck they both seemed
somewhat out of place among the white folk and preferred
a corner apart, in the dining-room they were kin
to all men.</p>

<p>I found them both extremely interesting, and when
the usual invitations were passed round for a continuance
of the acquaintanceship after landing, I accepted theirs
more readily than any other. Blunt and without finesse
as they were, there was an obvious cordiality and virility
in their manner, and no man alert to adventure turns so
promising an offer aside.</p>

<p>Months afterward I was in Auckland, New Zealand,
and made myself known to them. Most cordial was the
reception they gave me when I stepped upon the well-built
pier that jutted out into the inlet from the little
launch that brought me there. Back upon the knoll stood
Madame, her heavy head of curly hair loose about her
shoulders. Her very being greeted me with welcome,
firmness of foot and arm and calmness of poise proclaiming
her nativity. When I approached, her strong hand
grasped mine, her face beamed, and she led the way over
the grass-grown path to the porch with even more self-confidence
than when she had gone to her seat in the
saloon, on shipboard.</p>

<p>Yet it was no saloon they led me into, but a simple
hollow-tile structure with slate roofing and plain plastered
walls. Just an ordinary four-roomed house, the
haven of the rising pioneer. There were no decorations
on the walls, no modern equipment of any kind, not even
a stove. The table was machine-turned, the chairs ordinary,
and on the mantelpiece stood some bleached photographs.
My hosts went about in their bare feet, and
otherwise as loosely clad as the early November spring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
permitted. They prepared their meals on the open fire,
and the menu was as simple as anything ever offered
me; and for the first time in my life I ate boiled eels,
the great Maori staple and delicacy. Had it not been
for the emanation of her genial personality and his vigorous,
breezy, almost hard pleasure in my presence, I
should have felt chilled in that habitation. But in place
of things was sincere welcome. I had proof of that that
night, for I was placed in the guest-room, upon a soft,
comfortable bed, while my hosts themselves spread a
mattress on the floor in the living-room. Lest I misunderstand,
they explained that it was their custom, Maori
fashion, to sleep on the floor, as they preferred the hard
support to that of the yielding spring.</p>

<p>I woke next morning just as the sun peeped over the
hill directly into my window. It was a sober dawn,&mdash;just
a healthy flush of life, with crisp, invigorating air.
One branch of a young kauri pine-tree stretched across
the rising orb like nature rousing itself from sleep. And
in the other room I could hear my hosts moving quietly
about, preparing breakfast.</p>

<p>Without word of warning or any apparent welcome,
the wife's brother and his young bride arrived. It was
obvious that the visit was no unusual occurrence. They
made themselves as much a part of the place as possible,
and were ignored by the white man and his Maori wife
as though they were servants. Yet they were both, to
me at least, delightful. He was broad-shouldered, erect,
rounded of limb but muscular,&mdash;as handsome a boy of
twenty as I have ever seen, and it gave one joy to see
him mated to so fine a girl. Their beings vibrated to
each other with the joy of their union.</p>

<p>And she was as fine a mate for him. Though she accentuated
every feature of her sex, it was with the joy
of fitness for him, not with any effort to be alluring. She
wore a very close fitting middy-blouse, which made more
firm the rounded breasts of her young maidenhood. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
was supple and plump and moved with litheness and
grace, full of animal spirits. With an affected air she
swung about to the step of an American rag, and every
once in a while she would throw herself into her lover's
arms, and take a turn about out of sheer happiness. It
had never occurred to me how extremely civilized and
not primitive our rag-time music is until I saw these
young "savages" affect it. But however ill-fitting the
tune to their emotions, there was something absolutely
natural in their adoration and their rushing into each
other's arms which no amount of civilization could
tarnish.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they went digging for eels in the mud
of the inlet. While they were gone, my host and his wife
cleared the yard of overgrown weeds and rubbish.</p>

<p>"That's the way they are," said he. "All day long
they dance and fool away their time. They think they've
done a lot if they dig for eels all afternoon. When we
went away to Hawaii we left them to look after our
house without charging them any rent. This is what
we found when we returned. The whole place was overgrown
with weeds, the fences were broken down, the
gates were off, and the place was strewn with rubbish.
They don't know what it is to be careful." And he
struck a match to the heap of weeds he and his wife had
gathered.</p>

<p>Presently the two lovers returned with a basket full
of eels. The young "housewife" hung her catch by the
tails on the clothes-line to dry, and in a pail of clear
water washed the mud-suckers they had gathered as by-product.
Then they felt they were entitled to rest.</p>

<p>All afternoon until late evening they lay upon the
spring of an unused matressless bedstead, which stood
upon the veranda. Their heads were at the opposite
ends of the bed. He kicked his feet in the air, but every
time a move of hers showed more of her legs than he
thought proper, he pulled down her tight skirt. He held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
an accordion over him upon which he played a medley of
airs, while she whirled a soft hat with her fingers. From
their throats issued a fountain of song, harmonious only
in the spirit of joy which inspired it.</p>

<p>So far they might just as well have been guests at a
hotel for all the attention their elders paid to them. We
had had our meals by ourselves. They were simply tolerated.
But after nightfall, they joined their relatives
in a game of cards. Every move provoked a burst of
laughter, whether successful or unsuccessful to the
hilarious one, and never a suggestion of strife or thought
of gain was manifest.</p>

<p>The Maories are more sober than their kinsmen of the
upper South Seas. Life was never to them less than a
serious struggle. I daresay they are happier to-day
than they were in their own time, with peace and prosperity
guaranteed them. But that is problematical.
Laughter and play are to-day urgent necessities. The
dances and games that were native to them&mdash;when not
stimulated by some social event&mdash;do not come to them
with the same old spontaneity. It took considerable
begging on my part and nudging from Mr. Webb to
persuade the women to show me a native dance. Donning
her skirt of rushes, Mrs. Webb stepped into the
center of the room, giggling all the while, and insisting
that her sister-in-law dance with her. The latter took a
stick in her hand and they began. But after two or
three movements they doubled over with laughter, and
faltered. I kept urging them on. At last they caught
the spirit of it, and for a few minutes they were as though
possessed. Their movements, mainly of the hands and
hips, were not unlike those of the geisha dances of Japan.
They kept them up for fifteen minutes. Suddenly they
stopped, as though struck self-conscious, almost as a
modest girl who had wakened from a somnambulant
journey in her nightgown. They slipped into chairs,
and were silent. Then for about half an hour they sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
"yarning" soberly before the hearth fire. And something
sad seemed to creep away up the chimney.</p>

<p>The two young lovers decided they would take a bath,
and went into another chamber to heat the water. My
bed was spread for me; the hosts unrolled the mattress
which had been lying in the corner on the floor all day.
We retired. Then from the other room came sounds of
hilarious laughter, the splashing of water in the tub, and
the slapping of naked wet flesh. It kept up for hours,
long after midnight. When silence finally reigned over
the household, an adorably cool moon peeped in at our
windows, and I knew that the two lovers in the room
next mine were at last overcome by the conspiracy of
moonlight and fatigue.</p>

<p>"Did you hear those mad Maories?" said Mr. Webb
to me the first thing in the morning. "Such mad things!
To keep the whole house awake till long after midnight!"
Then he, too, seemed to become self-conscious. Wasn't
he passing reflections on the tribe of his wife? We
strolled out into the fields. He seemed to feel the necessity
of an explanation. Among his people, the white
folk, though he was not ostracized for having taken a
native wife (for it is common enough), still it did lower
one in the social scale. I steered the conversation round
till he himself spoke of it. He referred to his wife,
somewhat soberly. "I like her and am satisfied with
her. She's a good woman." And during the whole of
my visit I saw nothing to indicate that their marriage
was not a success. She was tidy, thrifty, and companionable.
He always treated her with respect and affection,
though once or twice with undue firmness. But she
always stood her ground with dignity and good-nature.
When he poked kindly fun at some photographs of her,
she smiled and winked at me. Then she said of a picture
taken of him on the beach: "I wouldn't lose it for all
the world, just for his sake."</p>

<p>By way of apology for the absence of more furnish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>ings,
they explained that they had sold out; they were
tired of labor conditions in New Zealand, of the too great
closeness to the "tribe" and in consequence had paid a
visit to Hawaii, where they bought a plantation. Thither
they went shortly afterward, the Briton and his Maori
wife, he to mix with his European cousins, she with her
Polynesian kinsfolk, and a more general reunion, after
centuries of separation, consummated.</p>

<p>Not the least lovable among the fifty-seven blends of
humanity that make up the inhabitants of the South
Seas and the Pacific are these Maories and their half-brothers
and sisters.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>From a Member of Parliament I had received several
letters of introduction, one of which was to the famous
Dr. Pomare, the native M. P. who represented native
interests in the Dominion's parliament. When I arrived
at Wellington, the capital, I presented myself at his
office and was received by a most genial, well-spoken,
widely read individual whose tongue would have entertained
the most sophisticated of European gatherings.
There was hardly a subject we touched in which he was
not well versed, and his native qualities rang out in
intermittent bursts of laughter such as only a healthy-minded
and healthy-bodied individual could indulge in.
When we began to discuss the question of the virtues
and vices of his native race, the Maories, he assured me:</p>

<p>"Oh, we're just like any people. There are good and
bad amongst us. Some of our people will sell their
lands, if they can, and buy an automobile which they run
madly about and then leave in an open plot in ruin. On
the other hand, one of our women has been very clever
with her property, has sold it off, and invested her money
in stocks so that to-day she owns the greatest number of
shares in the Wellington tram lines. So you see we are
just like other people."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>And so it is. But there is a slight exception, for I
have heard from every one that the tendency to revert
to type is very great, and that one of the wealthiest
native woman in the Dominion will frequently leave her
mansion, her jewels, her limousine, her fine clothes, and
spend a time in a Maori <i>pah</i>, eating eels in the good old
native way.</p>

<p>But such reversions cannot last long. Despite that
drift, there are indications of a racial recrudescence
through the half-castes, a tendency noticed by students
of the primitive peoples throughout the Pacific. Hope
for the Maories is in the younger elements who have that
happy mixture in them, called Pakeha-Maori. Visiting
a class of young women in a commercial school in Dunedin
I noticed among them one whose dark face and black
eyes were full of a certain wicked fascination. She was
as bright and alert as any member of the class. And
when I spoke of her to the head of the school, he said,
"Oh, that little half-caste girl." I should not have
known it.</p>

<p>One does not like to be too enthusiastic, but if these
savage Polynesians can in the course of three generations,
and with the aid of a slight mixture, change from
fierce cannibalism to something as sweet and lovable as
this, there is indeed great hope for them. What though
the prejudiced assure you that, however far the mixture
may have gone, it reveals itself in a tendency to squat
when least expected? There is in the most civilized of
us still enough of the savage strain to make us wary of
carrying our aversions too far.</p>

<p>Doubtless the Britons of New Zealand would enter
any debate with the Americans of Hawaii as to which is
the superior people, the Maories or the Hawaiians. For
our own peace of mind let us accept their Polynesian
kinship at the outset. Both are worth saving as separate
races or in mixture with others.</p>

<p>The Maori M. P., the rebellious priest, Rua, later re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>leased
from prison, the Hawaiian clerk in the throne-room,
the Fijian chief turned governor, the Samoan chief
in pajamas who, with the customs officials, boarded the
steamer anchored beyond the reefs, and Mrs. Webb, the
princess,&mdash;all these are natives playing the new part allotted
to them in this strange new world.</p>

<p>Thus slowly, into the life and fabric of the South Seas,
is coming this consciousness of rebirth. It is a new
class, a new race. Not the Eurasians, scorned by the
white and the superior Asiatics,&mdash;but the reverse. Half-caste,
but the proud possessors of the virtues of the
natives, with the strength and superiority of the white;
half-caste in blood but not always so in spirit.</p>

<small>GIVING HEARTS A NEW CHANCE</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>Casual, impermanent, or broken as these unions
hitherto have been, their cyclonic process of attraction
and repulsion has created a suction drawing in both
good and evil. The white sailor and vagabond who ravished
the brown maiden never intended to father the consequences.
But gradually, as communication increased
and mutual interests developed, greater stability entered
into the relations of the races. Marital contracts became
necessary and, from the point of view of property and
other acquisitions, even desirable. Readjustment of conceptions
of sex grew urgent. This entailed the complement,
divorce.</p>

<p>From all corners of the world came people whose
notions of man's relations with woman were as divergent
as the seas. The Japanese and Chinese brought their
Oriental attitude toward women; the American his Occidental.
Besides, with the passing of native control,
European nations superimposed European regulations
upon the islands. We have, then, the introduction of
legalism into the casual affairs of the tropics, and the
vanishing of primitive license. We have the Japanese
woman, subject to the control of her husband, finding
herself protected by the laws of another race. These
raise her status and her self-respect. She rebels against
unpleasant sex-unions. Divorce in these conglomerate
regions, therefore, means the idealization of sex, raising
it above the stage of animal possession and material
interest; based upon the sense of justice to woman, it
recreates marriage, makes decent unions possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence, in the wake of queer marriages we see even
more queer divorces, as though hearts, having become
self-conscious, seek a new chance. As age mellows racial
associations, we find that men's hearts the world over
beat as one, and relationships which are at all compatible
seek permanency, if not "normalcy."</p>

<p>It was easy enough for a wanderer or a few hundred
traders and romancers to leave their imprint on the
native races. It is another matter when the native races
are overwhelmed by a hundred thousand aliens of
twenty-odd races, and the work of amalgamation falls
to the lot of the white man. An altogether new problem
manifests itself,&mdash;not only that of bringing them together
in a legal and permanent manner, but of separating such
types and individuals as cannot work for the betterment
of the new race.</p>

<p>Throughout the Pacific already reviewed, the mixture
is as yet essentially accidental and occasional. But in
no spot in the Pacific has the problem assumed such serious
proportions as in Hawaii, where, added to the great
diversity of conglomerations, comes the factor of white
and Asiatic superiority in number. As we have seen,
the infusion of this flood of foreign blood into the thin
native element has fairly swamped it. This jungle of
humanity seems at first sight utterly beyond cultural
purification. The streets throb with such multiplicity of
little ways that one feels bewildered. One has to snatch
a sample of the life and place it beneath the magnifying-glass
of tradition and code to be able to separate it from
the whole. And that I did one day in Honolulu.</p>

<p>The sun was pouring down in veritable splutters of
softness and mellowness. It was warm in an all-embracing
tenderness of warmth. To be in the shade with
another human being was here as unifying in spirit as
sitting before an open fire is on a blizzardy day in the
North. And on such a day I entered the court-room of
Honolulu. The dusty tread of people from every land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
has sounded across this court-house floor and all the
simple tragedies of life with their hoarse warnings have
been enacted within its walls. Hundreds of disappointed
men and women have come into that room hoping to have
their lives straightened out, their affections given a new
chance.</p>

<p class="caption">BEAUTY IS MORE THAN SKIN-DEEP<br />
In these two cases it obviously goes back to their Hawaiian and European blood</p>
</div>

<p>When I entered, the court-room was empty. A massive
Hawaiian looked in, and walked away. Then a thin
white man approached and, when he learned what brought
me, he sat down on one of the wooden benches to talk to
me. It was Judge William L. Whitney, who died in New
York just recently.</p>

<p>Presently, an emaciated-looking Chinese entered and
sat down to wait. A small, wrinkled, sallow little woman
from the Celestial Republic, accompanied by a compatriot,
came in after him, and seated herself a little
distance away. Then came the fat Hawaiian again who
had peered in earlier, and with that everything seemed
in order. Judge Whitney left me, approached the bench,
and, though he wore only his ordinary street clothes, he
was forthwith crowned with the halo of his office.</p>

<p>The proceedings began. Proceedings in this case
meant great round eyes rolling in tremendous sockets, a
tongue free with the dialects and linguistics of every
mixture, and a temperament free from ambition or guile.
The judge could speak no Chinese, the respondents could
speak no English, the witnesses (of whom two strayed in
later) could speak neither English nor Chinese,&mdash;and so
among them the Hawaiian interpreter had all the fun to
himself. He was in reality the dispenser of justice.</p>

<p>The case was rehearsed. The Chinese was suing his
wife for divorce.</p>

<p>"Where were you when you saw this man kiss your
wife?" asked the judge.</p>

<p>The interpreter took up the question in Chinese as
though the language were part of his inheritance, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
after the Chinese spoke, back came the reply through
the lips of the Hawaiian, but in the first person.</p>

<p>"I was in the garden. When I looked up into our bedroom
I saw this man kiss my wife."</p>

<p>The evidence was vague. To John Chinaman it meant
more than a few facts, for his wife had borne him no offspring.
What a timid-daring attempt to reach out for
new life! At home he would just have dismissed her, but
here it was different. Yet from their appearance it was
doubtful that either of them would ever have the courage
to try to live life over.</p>

<p>This was only one of the many entangled lives that
came to be straightened out in Hawaii. There are more
than forty-seven different combinations of races there,
such as American and American, German and German,
Korean and Korean, Russian and Russian, Spanish-Marshall
and English, Half-Hawaiian and Chinese-Hawaiian,
Hawaiian and Chinese-Hawaiian, Hawaiian
and Hawaiian-Portuguese, Chinese and Chinese, Hawaiian
and Hawaiian, Portuguese and Portuguese, Spanish
and Spanish, Spanish-Hawaiian and Spanish-Hawaiian,
Portuguese and Creole-Spanish-Portuguese,
Chinese and Irish, American and Half-Hawaiian, Portuguese
and Pole, Half-Hawaiian and Half-Hawaiian,
American and Hawaiian-Chinese, English and Half-Hawaiian,
Japanese and American, American-Japanese
and Japanese, Half-Hawaiian and German, Portuguese
and Hawaiian, German and Irish, Hawaiian-Chinese and
Spanish-Italian, Portuguese and Hawaiian-Chinese,
Half-Hawaiian and Spanish, Porto-Rican and Porto-Rican,
Oginawa and Oginawa, French-Porto-Rican and
Porto-Rican, Swede and Portuguese, English and English,
Hawaiian and Chinese, American and French-Spanish,
Portuguese and Japanese, American-Portuguese
and German-Irish, Portuguese-Hawaiian and
Portuguese, Portuguese and German-Irish, Portuguese-Hawaiian
and Portuguese, Portuguese-Irish and Hawai<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>ian,
Hawaiian and American-Negro, Portuguese-Hawaiian-Chinese
and Chinese. And I am certain that I can
add another, that of my New Zealand acquaintance and
his Maori wife.</p>

<p>They are but one phase of the whole problem of the
mixture of races and the melting of their silvers and
bronzes down to the human essence within them. For
there were in Judge Whitney's time on an average of
two hundred and thirty couples divorced under that ceiling
every year. Figures make human facts seem so remote
that I hate to use them. As soon as figures are
quoted the individuals lose their identity. That which is
living and real becomes, as it were, an astronomical calculation
and one might as well talk of stars. But the
figures of the divorces in Hawaii are in themselves a
living thing, as they interpret the life there more than
words could do; so I'll risk giving a few of the figures
Judge Whitney published while I was in Honolulu.</p>

<p>The Japanese contributed 49% of the divorces in
Hawaii, though they comprise only 34% of the population;
the Americans, 7%, though they were 8% of the
population. The rest were distributed among the other
nationalities. This is how those statistics compared
with divorce statistics in other countries. There were
in England out of every hundred thousand inhabitants,
two divorces per year; in Austria, one; in Norway, six;
in Sweden, eight; in Italy, three; in Denmark, seventeen;
in Germany, twenty-three; and in France, the same; in
the United States, seventy-three; and in the island of
Oahu (Honolulu), four hundred.</p>

<p>Hundreds of little folk, a host of children, have passed
out of that room either fatherless or motherless. Back
in the lands which they might have called home it would
not have happened in just this way, or having happened
so, it would not have had the same tragic meaning. For
in Oriental countries fathers frequently put the mothers
of their children aside. Yet, somehow the tragedies do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
not fret and strut in such distorted ways in lands where
distortion is much more common, as in the East. In most
Oriental countries it is enough for a man to say his wife
talks too much and declare her divorced, but when he
comes to the half-way house, Hawaii, he must be cruel,
extremely cruel to his wife before the law will grant him
a divorce. So he is "cruel" in a way he may be sure will
secure his freedom.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>What the results of all these mixtures will be, no one
can as yet tell, but the consensus of opinion gives the
Chinese-Hawaiian the prize for superiority. However
promiscuous other races may be, the Japanese seldom
stoops to conquer in that way. The maiden of Japan
shares with the white woman an aversion for these strangers
in Hawaii, though the number of Japanese women
who marry white men is far greater than that of white
women marrying into any of the races in the Pacific.</p>

<p>One of the most prolific causes of divorce in Hawaii
has been the so-called "picture bride." Because of the
exclusion of Asiatic laborers, few Japanese and Chinese
women have been born in the island. But because of their
preference for their own women, Japanese sent home for
wives. To get round the exclusion laws, they stretched
the home process a bit, selected by photograph the girls
they wished, had themselves married by proxy (a method
recognized in Japan as legal), and then simply sent for
their "wives." Aside from the subsequent divorces
which very frequently ensued, there have been cases not
without their humorous sides.</p>

<p>One story was told that must be accepted with caution.</p>

<p>Mr. Goto, who just a short while ago was Goto San,
wants a wife. He sees a go-between who secures for him
the pictures of some girls of his own district. He makes
his selection and the process of marriage is accomplished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
With something little short of glee, he waits the maid's
arrival.</p>

<p>She comes. But alas, not alone! Mr. Goto waits with
others at the pier. Everybody is blessed but him. Chagrin
and impatience battle in his heart. Nearly everybody
has been supplied with a wife. There are only two women
left. Neither seems to be the one he married. Goto
thinks,&mdash;thinks rapidly. Who will ever know the difference?
He claims the prettier; she accepts him, and off
they dash on their honeymoon, &agrave; la Occident, a two-day
trip round the island of Oahu in a motor-car. And never
were nuptials more satisfactory.</p>

<p>In the meantime Fujimoto San comes rushing up pell-mell.
His garage business has kept him. He finds a
lone girl, but she does not tally with the reproduction
he married. "Not so nice," is the first thought that
flashes across his brain. "Little too broad in the nose,
lips thicker than those on the photograph. Can I mistake?"
But she is the only one left. He bows at least
a half-dozen times, bows clean over, half-way to the
ground, but alas! every time his head bobs up he sees
the same disheartening face, a face he never ordered, a
face he cannot accept. He must clear up the mystery.
He calls the agent. Investigations reveal that Goto was
there ahead of him; so Fujimoto sets out on a chase after
the honeymoon pair. It ends in Honolulu two days later,
and another divorce case comes up in court.</p>

<p>The "picture bride" is now a thing of the past, as the
Japanese Government has agreed to deny her a passport
in accordance with the spirit of our treaty with
Japan. From the point of view of immigration, this may
be a solution; but there is a phase of the problem of the
mixture of races in Hawaii I have never yet seen discussed,&mdash;that
is, the woman. In the case of the Japanese
woman, much more than in that of the man, entrance to
Hawaii or America is freedom such as has never been
known before. At home she has been taught obedience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
and deference to her husband. There are many others
ready to accept that burden if she is unwilling. But in
Hawaii, where there are so many Japanese seeking wives
and where she moves among peoples whose standards are
an inversion of everything she has been taught to regard
as virtuous and feminine, she finds herself in an altogether
different position. On the streets she sees many
white women treated with courtesy; in the courts women
receive even more sympathy than men,&mdash;to her an
unheard-of thing. And so we find that when all the
divorces in the Hawaiian Islands have been tabulated,
these little timid creatures of Japan have been emboldened
to the extent of deserting their husbands in veritable
shoals, making up 90% of the entire number of Japanese
divorces. It is a scramble for readjustment of conjugal
relations based on something nearer emotional equality.</p>

<p>But where do the Hawaiians come in? will be asked in
all reason. They are virtually no more. Of the entire
race which at the time of their discovery by Captain Cook
numbered some 130,000 to 300,000, only a few thousand
are left. At the time of the annexation of Hawaii by
America (1898) there were some 31,000 Hawaiians of
pure blood, or about 28% of the population. Of Orientals
there was about 42% of the population, with 24,400
Japanese and 21,600 Chinese. Then there were 15,191
Portuguese, 2,250 Britons, 1,437 Germans, 8,400 Americans,
1,479 Norwegians, French and others combined.
Already there were 8,400 part-Hawaiian. From the rulers
down there was a free mixture, even the queen had a
white spouse. Some of the best types of Hawaiian
women had been married by men of fine caliber, unlike
almost any other place in the Pacific. The relationships
were of a permanent nature, for, as the governmental
report in connection with annexation stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Hawaiians are not Africans, but Polynesians. They are brown,
not black. There has never been and there is not any color line in
Hawaii as against native Hawaiian, and they participate fully and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
an equality with the white people in affairs, political, social, religious,
and charitable. The two races freely intermarry one with the other,
the results being shown in a population of some 7,000 of mixed blood.
They are a race which will in the future, as they have in the past,
easily and rapidly assimilate with and adopt American ways and
methods.</p></div>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>In defiance of prejudice, intermarriage between the
races in the Pacific is taking place. What the result is
to be, no one as yet knows definitely. The number of
white men legalizing their relations with native women
is large. The tropics are veritable whispering-galleries
sounding the stories of men who have returned to keep
their promises even after they have been despatched
from the islands under the influence of the cup so as to
prevent their marrying. In the mid-Pacific, in the
South Seas, in the Far East, white men are marrying
native women, even in cases where these have been their
mistresses for years.</p>

<p>In Japan, many leading white men have married
Japanese women, among whom the most celebrated has
been Lafcadio Hearn. The list is long. In the ports,
many foreigners have married Japanese women, and
though there is a strong feeling against it socially,
discrimination is not universal. The French and the
British are not nearly so fastidious in these matters as
are the Americans and the Japanese. Wherever there
is outward opposition, it comes from the Japanese side
as well as from the white. Japanese complain against
discrimination here, but we are received with no more
open arms by them in Japan.</p>

<p>The girl from Japan coming to the West is by virtue
of her immigration alone to some extent emancipated;
but to the white woman turning her steps east there is
only the emancipation, in part, from drudgery by means
of ample servants. To the white woman who goes a
step farther and links herself in marriage with a Japa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>nese
or Chinese there is in the majority of cases only
sorrow, soreness of heart, isolation, and regret. It is
not that she might not be happy with the individual Oriental,
but in the East she becomes part of a vicious family
system that strangles her individuality. Though the maid
of Japan is not over-welcome in the West, as the wife of a
white man she comes into a higher plane of life. By no
means is that true in the case of the white woman in
the East. There are too many cases, still warm with
regret, to be named in proof of the statement. I have
come across several cases of American girls who had
married Japanese and returned with them to Japan.
They were content enough with their husbands, but their
position in the Japanese home was intolerable. I remember
the loneliness of a New York girl who had gone to
live in Kyoto. The contemptuous way in which some
notable Japanese looked at their countryman's white wife
was only comparable to the treatment she would have
received here. The children, born in the same labor, are
not respected as are either "pure" Japanese or white.
The Eurasian is frequently disqualified. The white
father regrets that his children are not Aryan as did
Lafcadio Hearn.</p>

<p>This is no attempt to make out a case for the mixture
of natives and white in the Pacific. There are not enough
facts at hand. Unfortunately, for the next few hundred
years the differences between the peoples living on the
borders of the Pacific will continue to irritate, and experiments
in blood-mixture will probably be tried externally.
I have only mobilized such incidents as have come within
my own personal observation that will take the problem
out of the cold, statistical plane. It is with human flesh
and blood, human hearts and affections, human gropings
and aspirations that we are dealing,&mdash;not with the conflicts
of imaginary hordes and with terrifying invasions.</p>

<p>To me, the human elements in Honolulu and throughout
the Pacific remain a memory of one perpetual stirring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of sounds, colors, and desires. The whole is not confusing,
for it is outside one's consciousness. In a sense it is
an inverted world consciousness. Instead of nationals
thinking outward, they have come together and are thinking
inward, recognizing themselves as part of some
whole. Eventually, after all the races in the Pacific have
been mixed more or less, or have proved mixture impossible,
they will find some way in which they can dwell at
one another's elbows without nudging. The mixture
may even assume an appearance of unity. The color
scheme, like a thorough blending of all the colors of
the spectrum, may yet become white.</p>

<small>"THIS LITTLE PIG WENT TO MARKET"</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>The basket was growing heavier and heavier, and
his stomach weaker and weaker. How to convert
his burden into a meal was a problem, written as large
upon his face as the delight in the bargains he was making
shone in the face of the marketer beside him. He
was a young chap just emerging from boyhood. He had
been employed by this restaurant-keeper because he said
he needed a meal. It was not to be a real job. He was
to get his meal all right, but not till he earned it by
going with the boss to market and carrying his basket
for him.</p>

<p>The basket was soon full to overflowing, and the
young man bearing it was nigh exhaustion. They were
now going home. At the corner of the open square that
had been assigned to garden-truck venders the old
man stopped to buy a rose. He disputed the price
with the flower-girl, got it at a reduction, and went on.
"I always bring my wife a rose from market," he
remarked in semi-soliloquy, and they disappeared, the
young fellow with his burden, the old man with his rose.</p>

<p>Thus does the European little pig go to market, and
he's the most civilized little pig in the world. For hundreds
of years he has been learning to market, and that
most essential of social functions is the progenitor of
communal life. The way in which it is performed is a
test of the civilization of a people.</p>

<p>The first democrats and artists of Europe, the Greeks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
knew this, and made the agora a market-place, a focus
of public art, and the scene of their political gatherings.
Wretched, indeed, was the little pig that stayed home
when the agora was convoked, for he it was whom the
Greeks had determined to ostracize. Despite their
efforts as democrats, there were only too many who
had to stay home when the affairs of that world were
being decided; but as a market, with all the architectural
genius concentrated on making it attractive and beautiful,
and Socrates leading his classes through it, it was a
certain success.</p>

<p>In the ruder parts of Europe, owing to the absence
of means of communication and the dangers of carrying
one's possessions abroad, definite market-places became
an imperative necessity, and charters for their existence
were granted by decree. They became an important
means of securing revenue.</p>

<p>Even the Church recognized the value of festivals as
means of enriching itself in a combination of barter with
merrymaking and adoration. Festivals and fairs alike
enhanced the material and the artistic life of medieval
Europe, and marked, as it were, the embryonic element
out of which grew all the later laws and ethics of trade.
The legitimacy of piracy at sea and robbery on land
had to be counteracted in some way, and the dignity and
decency of exchange established.</p>

<p>The evolutionary process by which civilization has
achieved some sort of business morality may yet be traced
in various countries, especially among the primitive peoples
of the South Seas, the more advanced Filipinos, the
recently awakened Japanese, the Mexicans, and the accomplished
New Zealanders. Beneath the surface of the
market-place, the wide world over, one finds the source
of civilization, and at its level, the level of human commonalty.
For as men hunt to cover up their love of wild
life and nature, so women market as an excuse for mingling
with people. There is in the behavior of the mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>keter
all the cunning of the animal in search of prey, and
the degree to which these instincts are developed gives in
a sense the measure of a man's civilization.</p>

<p>Even outside the bonds of law and order the mere
process of exchange tends to establish social ethics. This
is nowhere better exemplified than at the thieves' market
in Mexico or in the hidden reaches of the Orient. Thither
all robbers bring their stolen wares for sale. Thither
all the robbed hasten, to recover their lost property.
The instinct within each and all of them is the gambling
spirit. The despoiler is eager to sell as quickly and as
successfully as possible lest the rightful owner arrive
and claim the booty. The general public is anxious to
buy, for the prices naturally are low, and many a bargain
may be secured. The despoiled, chagrined though
they may be at their loss, are in part compensated by the
hope of a purchase made at somebody else's expense.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>I had not known that buying and selling was ever part
of the scheme of things among people whose needs were
as few as those of the South-Sea islanders. Saints and
philosophers are always teaching us that the most desirable
state is that in which wants are few, and their
indulgence is still more limited. But it seems to me that
where that condition holds, the few necessaries of life
become so much more desirable and so much more difficult
to obtain that, instead of a release from slavery,
slavery is even more rigorous. Our pictured impressions
of the tropics are full of breadfruit-trees and fruits
growing in abundance without labor. But quite the contrary
is the case. The fear of famine and the insecurity
of life have dampened the joys of many a wild man, and
the pressure of population has only too frequently
resulted in infanticide and cannibalism.</p>

<p>When, therefore, I heard that there was to be a native<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
bazaar across the Rewa River, in Vita Levu, the largest
island of the Fiji group, I defied the yellow sun that hung
overhead, secured a complement of guides in two Fijian
boys who were more afraid of me than they were of
their chief, and set out for real primitive excitement.
We were pulled across the river on a punt secured to
each shore by a cable, and made our way up the banks
in the direction of the sugar-mill.</p>

<p>It was noon when we arrived at the fair-grounds.
Aside from long wooden tables that stood beneath arbors
of palms, there was nothing completed by way of preparation.
A few straggling natives wended their ways
from hut to hut of slab-board and thatch, their quiet
manners reminding me of the monks in monasteries,
absorbed in their duties. Gradually, venders arrived;
the tables began to sprout with banana-leaves and
flowers. Strings of berry beads were displayed, like
fish out of water,&mdash;appealing eyes of the plant world
asking why, with nature so near at hand, they needed
to be torn from life. Bottles of liquid fats, like capsules
of the castor-plant, stood ensconced in green-leaved packages
containing sweet messes that left the eager natives,
old and young, literally web-handed.</p>

<p>The goods displayed, the crowds from the surrounding
huts arrived, drawn by an irresistible charm. A Fijian
never came with his mate; maiden never approached on
her lover's arm. Though they all appeared indiscriminately,
there was no obvious grouping of friends with
friends. They moved like shoals of fish that had got the
scent or the sight of food. It was a crowd with every
evidence of cohesiveness except that of companionship.</p>

<p>To me there was something pathetic in that crowd.
An outsider by all the laws of centuries of contrary
development, I had no means of entering their emotional
lives, of guessing the promptings which made them leave
privacy for herding. I had only the most outward signs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
to go by, and I thought what spiritless, barren lives they
must lead who could be brought together on such an
occasion in so casual a mood. For aside from the bottles
of oil, the strings of beads, and the wrappings of
stuff in banana-leaves, there was nothing from my view
to make a hundred or two hundred thousand pounds of
sluggish flesh rise from its mats and dare the piercing
sun.</p>

<p>Yet the women, who did most of the selling, with their
unkempt hair and their crude alien costumes, awoke to
something universal under the game of barter they were
here called upon to play crudely. Rummage-sales and
carnivals, dog-shows and dances, likewise change the
glitter of blue eyes and pink cheeks; and I smiled at the
thought of Lao-tsze and Tolstoy, who between 650 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
and <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1910 preached the ugliness of trade.</p>

<p>When the play of barter and exchange had stirred
these primitive folk to a little more life, they quite naturally
sought a way of giving it off again; but so foreign
did a real bazaar seem to them that they entered the
recreations with little zest. In these days of savage
sedateness, with trade becoming more and more a feature
and a pastime of life, it is not surprising that the
natives attend with spirits in abeyance. Following the
great exchange of beads and oils and edible messes, the
crowds moved out to a more open space, under the clear
sun. There, with the aid of a native band, under the
conductorship of a Catholic priest, they made merry,
with strange sounds and more familiar dances. But it
all seemed perfunctory and not without a touch of sadness.
The Fijian voice at its best is rich, deep, and
stately. One cannot imagine it attuned to singing jazz
or rag-time. It seems exclusively made for hymns. In
consequence, the crowds could not rise to the occasion,
and stood behind the entertainers like so many solemn
Japanese in the presence of royalty.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<h4>3</h4>

<p>But lest the little pig who stays at home may really
starve to death, the world sometimes indulges him a
little by letting the market go to him, and never have I
seen a market more picturesque and more self-possessed
than one of this sort that visited our steamer as she
lay anchored in the harbor of Manila.</p>

<p>All about us during the night had crept Filipino
lighters, their gunwales capped with low-arched mats.
They hugged the steamer like a brood of younglings waiting
for their food. They were to receive the cargo of
boxes and canned goods from New York and other markets
of the world.</p>

<p>It was still cool. A native Filipino woman squatted
on the ridge of a lighter top between two men. She
was enjoying her morning cigarette. As she caught
my gaze her face beamed flirtatiously. Then and there
I tried my tongue for the first time in the real use of
Spanish, and failed. As the morning advanced, children
crept from the darkness of the covered lighters; charcoal
pails were fanned into a glow like that of the dawn; and
roosters, tied to the boats by one leg with a string,
crowed, their contempt, protest, or indifference to a gluttonous
and unjust world.</p>

<p>As the hour of breakfast's needs arrived, a thin, long
canoe came up, insinuating its way among the many more
capacious crafts, quietly, slowly, like a thing just stirring
with the new day. On its narrow bottom flopped dozens
of little fish in agony, dying of too much air. They looked
like so many bars of silver when they lay dead. A basket
of bananas and a few simple vegetables comprised the
rest of the stock of these aquatic tradespeople, this man
and his woman. She squatted comfortably, looking
from side to side for customers, while he pushed the
canoe along with easy strokes. They did not cry their
wares, and handed their stores out as though known to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
all for fair dealing and fearless of competition. Thus
with the freshness of morning air they stimulated this
little world to action.</p>

<p>By noon that day I was slipping through narrow
streets, avoiding the moldy shops of the main street,
seeking out the men and women who make life interesting.
The coolness of the morning was gone, crowded
out by steaming noon. The casual, gift-like manners of
those two aquatic traders was now a thing not even to
expect, for I was in the midst of civilized trade.
Unexpectedly, I came upon the public market.</p>

<p>What a different world! The hand of the law was in
evidence. Here, despite the general confused appearance,
the concrete drains and stone tables gave an assurance
of at least periodical cleansing. Here the laws of
barter held men tied to fair dealing, as the roosters were
tied to those lighters. Venders make a mad dash for
freedom through cheating, but were jerked back to honesty
by the bargain-hunter who watches the scales and
knows the laws. Values are measured by the size of the
pupil or the intensity of the gaze; if eagerness is manifest,
up goes the price.</p>

<p>A Buddhist, looking upon a market like this, if he
were unaccustomed to pagan ways, would shrink from
the sight as we would at a cannibal feast. Here the
world was calmly cruel. All the things we eat lay in
their naked ghastliness,&mdash;the thin streams of blood, the
bulging eyes of little creatures, the stiff inflexibility of
limbs once quick and supple. And the men and women
were unconsciously affected by the scene.</p>

<p>For nothing stimulates the snarling quarrelsomeness
of human beings more than the sight of food or the fear
of imposition. The appeals of the sellers were mingled
with the bargainings and bickerings of the buyers, a
competition among both to best one another. Two women
stood over a fish-bin engaged in a matching of wits that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
might well have been envied by filibustering senators.
The debate was over a tray of tiny fish.</p>

</div>

<p>A white woman, firmly knit in body and in character,
made her way through the many aisles, purchasing with
a precision as clearly civilized as it was silent. A Spanish
woman, dark and dashing, swung through the same
aisles like a little whirlwind. There was brilliance in
her eyes, and brilliancy in the gems on her fingers and
in her ears. She was exceedingly well dressed, buxom,
and attractive, but every purchase was made with a gust
of austerity and command quite uncalled for. She bullied
the fisherwoman, she bullied her hackman, she bullied
the servant who had come to carry her purchases for
her; and then she sat down at one of the little restaurant
tables and ate the strange concoctions with a dexterity
obviously native to her. She was a half-caste, but the
Spanish vein was strong in her blood, and Spanish passion
actuated her. She got into her ancient-looking
hackney-coach with flash and gusto; but not, however,
before she had gained her point in the matter of an extra
piece of fat upon which she was insisting. She was the
little pig who had roast beef because she knew how to
market economically.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>But the little pig that has none, and the one who cries,
<i>wee! wee! wee!</i> all the way home, in the Far East, is
like the Greek about to be ostracized by the community
in the agora. Indeed, he has been ostracized in Japan
for hundreds of years, and even modernization and
imperial edict have changed his status but little. He is
known as the <i>eta</i>. To him has been allotted the task of
attending to dead animals, whether edible or not, and
though his touch profanes the lowest classes of Japan,
his labor keeps the country clean after a fashion. Much
more. Not only do these outcasts remove dead carcasses
from a careless Oriental world, but in one place
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
at least they have been given the sweetest of all professions,&mdash;that
of selling flowers with which to decorate the
<i>tokonoma</i>, the most honorable place in the Japanese
home. And all through the day, if one is not too
much engrossed in the marts of the foreign settlement,
one will hear the voice of these flower-girls calling plaintively,
"<i>Hana! hana-i! hana-iro!</i>" Flowers are the
things that stand between her and the degradation of
her class, because for years the shrine of a loyal servant
of the neglected emperor who was struggling against a
greater and more powerful group of disloyal Japanese
had been kept fresh with flowers by these <i>eta</i>, or outcasts,
who did not know whose grave they cherished.</p>

</div>

<p>Otherwise the market in Japan is in the hands of
Japanese now in good social standing, men who before
the opening of the country numbered among those not
much above the outcasts. To be in trade was worse in
Japan than in England, and when one watches the
behavior of men at markets, one is not surprised. One
who takes the average trader at his word in Japan&mdash;not
the big concerns, to be sure&mdash;deserves to cry, <i>wee!
wee! wee!</i> all the way home.</p>

<p>While all over the world woman goes to market, in
Japan the market goes to her. She has had to have
most of her daily supplies brought to her door by the
cobbler, the bean-curd-maker, or the fisherman. In consequence,
except when she has servants, she has been
deprived of the educational advantages of market gossip,
and has been kept in her sphere more easily. She
will be the last to come forward to freedom.</p>

<p>Not so the men. All the social advantages of barter
and exchange are theirs. They communicate their experiences
to one another at four o'clock in the morning over
the fish-tub. They test their wits and their eyes with
the auctioneer who starts them running in competition
with one another over an attractive specimen from the
sea. Or the more imaginative resist confusion in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
pit of the stock-market, where they keep in touch with
their entire country and with the world. They are
becoming, in consequence, more efficient and more practised
in world-wide ethics of business.</p>

<p>Yet within the last few years public markets have
sprung into vogue in Japan, and I look toward a revolution
in the relations of the sexes, for no woman who goes
to market remains long an obedient and submissive little
soul. This is obvious to any one who wanders into the
market of Shanghai. There one can see the status of
the various women who replenish their household supplies
and the most humble, it seemed to me, was the
woman of Japan. She moved about like <i>Priscilla</i> suddenly
brought back to life and sent to compete with the
modern American woman.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>In ancient Greece, of course, no woman of refinement
went marketing herself. She sent her slaves. But in
modern New Zealand not only are there no slaves, but
there is no one to do any personal service of that nature.
In the old days, in Europe, the market was the general
rendezvous where life played its pranks at all levels.
The religious festivals also afforded dramatic pageantry,
and sometimes the two interplayed with each other. But
in our modern times, when the public market is largely
supplanted by the great department store, shielded, protected,
organized into a minimum of human interest and
a maximum of efficiency, the charm of the market is
no more. So, too, our festivals have surrendered much
of their artistry. This was somewhat revived during
the war. New Zealand, because of the still evident
atmosphere of pioneer life, the lack of interlocking systems
of communication, and its distance from the most
advanced places in the world, still affords some of that
simple charm of a life one reads about. The streets of
the main cities nightly resemble something one has dimly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
heard of and never hoped to see. The people have laid
aside all thought of business or barter. There is in their
attitude something of that suppressed amazement that
revealed the thoughts of the South-Sea islanders when
asked to thrill to an alien band conducted by the Catholic
priest. Both the whites and the primitives seemed to recall
that once they knew how to celebrate.</p>

<p>Queens Street of Auckland was decorated one day, and
booths were erected on which simple products were
offered for sale. A parade of two fire-department
machines, a number of men in Chinese costumes, others
painted and foolscapped, boys with enormous masks, and
girls in dominoes, marched through the city, and in their
wake was a rush of just plain pedestrians. Other than
that nothing happened. From five to ten thousand
people jammed the street. The crowd was essentially like
every other crowd in the world,&mdash;the same in gregariousness,
the same in hunting after pleasure that abideth but
a moment.</p>

<p>One evening the events were more thrilling. Sulky
races, men driven by girls, and May-pole dances round
the street lamps that stand between the tram-lines gave
a suggestion of antiquity to the city. The only difference
between these performances and those in the upper
regions of the tropics was in the absence of palms and
green arbors. In place of wide spaces were narrow
streets, lined with brick buildings and studded with iron
poles whose only blossoms were glowing electric lights,
and whose only branches were pairs of stiff arms holding
the trolley wires.</p>

<p>So, too, the market side of this carnival was a sharp
contrast to the fairs and markets in more modernized
communities. Britons are essentially traders, but they
trade by rule. Even when they play trading, as at this
carnival, they are more constrained. What little was
done to allay the sober spirit was revived by the element
of barter. The gambling spirit, checked in normal times,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
was stimulated. Raffles, wheels, and rings were employed
to extract coins from the under-zealous. The only abandon
was in the confetti, which was scattered generously
about in the throngs.</p>

<p>In the booths conservation was the key-note. Everything,
from motor-cars to potatoes, was auctioned and
raffled. A man from Coney Island, accustomed to that
hysterical release of emotion, would have felt that he
was attending not a carnival, but an open market in
which only the basic necessities of life were in demand.</p>

<p>Not so in Napier, New Zealand, or in Sydney, Australia.
There they seem as different from their British
ancestry as Hottentots are from Polynesians. There
men and women know how to make merry in ways almost
unforgettable, and to ripple the smooth surface of sedate
civilization with lovely flirtations that would weaken the
most stoic of mortals and paragons of propriety.</p>

<p>Otherwise, in all New Zealand, life goes along in its
leisurely, businesslike way. Men attend horse-sales with
great zest; salesmen rush across the country in their
little motor-cars, bringing the wares of the world's elaborate
markets to the doors of stations or ranches; auctioneers
dash hither and thither to confuse, if they can,
farmers into the exchange of sheep or cattle.</p>

<p>While tramping along the road to Wellington, I was
overtaken by a touring-car.</p>

<p>"Want a ride?" asked the driver. And when I
mounted, he asked: "Seeing our little country, are you?
Nothing like it in the world. Ever been to a sheep auction?
Want to come along?" And the next thing I
knew we were rushing over the dirt road toward Onga
Onga. We drew up at the accommodation house with a
sudden jolt.</p>

<p>The guest-room was filled with farmers. Sallow,
hollow-cheeked, with voices that seemed to plow through
their brains for thoughts, their conversation was labored.
Dinner was devoured in semi-silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>But when they got to the stockyards, they became more
alert. The auctioneer mounted the fence like an orator.
He began cackling like a bewitched hen. The farmers
moved about, feeling sheep offered for sale, the more
expert glancing at them with pride in judgment. One
sleek farmer, whose elaborate motor-car stood by the
roadside, scrutinized the yards as one who might buy
the entire lot as a whim.</p>

<p>The psychology of the auction-sale crowd is distinct
from that of the bargain-hunter. The latter believes
himself to be the winner because of the confessed misjudgment
of the trader. But the auction-buyer moves
about quietly, makes his own judgments of values,
exchanges opinions only with his associates, and waits
his chances. At a bargain-counter every one rushes for
the thing he wants; here the very thing most wanted is
ignored, as though to lead other hunters off the scent.
As soon as the sale was over, men fell apart, like boiling
rice in a pot when suddenly douched with cold water.</p>

<p>So far has civilized man made certain the processes
by which he secures the satisfaction of his wants that
one begins to wonder why men like to buy and sell at
all. They are like the artisans and the mechanists who
have become specialized and divorced from contact with
the living, finished product. So much so is this true that
much of New Zealand's real marketing is done in London.
Once the manager of a station wired his London
principals:</p>

<p class="center">SNOWING DURING LAMBING</p>

<p>The principals, according to New Zealand's version,
replied:</p>

<p class="center">STOP LAMBING AT ONCE</p>


<h4>6</h4>

<p>Wander where one may this wide world over, one
finds that the places to which tourists are drawn mostly
are the markets. There one finds the richest reward for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
curiosity. The traveler in foreign lands, especially if
he is alone and somewhat homesick, knows no pleasanter
thrill than the sight upon the pier, amid cargoes from
every known quarter of the globe, of a box of canned
goods stamped in black-stenciled letters with the seven
signs of bliss, "<span class="smcap">NEW YORK</span>."</p>

<p>When lost in that good old town, it had never occurred
to him that ships trail the seven seas carrying canned
soups and fruits and vegetables to black-faced, sprawling-toed
savages. But out there in the wide spaces of
the globe he realizes how strikingly alike are the alimentary
failings of mankind. Lost in reminiscences, when on
Broadway again, he thinks himself forever cut off from
romance, until he happens to turn into a side street, a
public market, or even a small chain-store grocery. There
he finds that in a way romance is not dead. The sedate
housewife permits herself on occasion to flirt with the
butcher or the baker; incidents the on-looker has not
thought possible prevail here as well as in the markets
of the Orient. And packages with the imprint of Japan,
of China, coffee from South America, awaken in him
memories irresistible. He goes away wishing he were
again off there where New York seems like romance to
him. The day will never come when silks and spices and
marts will not conjure up in the minds of the most prosaic
the very essence of romance.</p>

DISCUSSION OF THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS

AUSTRALASIA, ASIA
AND AMERICA</h2>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>AUSTRALASIA</small></h3>


<p>New Zealand and Australia are to-day the only
spots in the world wherein the white race may expand
without encroaching upon already existing and
developed races. The extent to which they are taking
advantage of their opportunities, the extent to which
they are enlarging the scope and the quality of progressive
civilization is the measure of their right to the maintenance
of their exclusive "White-Australasia" policy.</p>

<p>I confess at the outset that I am at a loss for an adequate
argument against this policy. Narrow, selfish,
dog-in-the-manger-like as it may be, we are faced with
the other question: From time out of mind China and
India have had two of the largest slices of the world's
surface. What have they done with them? How can
India and Asia, having littered up their domains with
human beings, ask that more of the world be turned over
to them for a repetition of the same ghastly reproduction?
They have made it impossible, with their degradation
of womanhood and their exaltation of caste and
ancestry, for new life to start with anything like a decent
chance. Is there not every reason to believe that
permitted to take up quarters in the open spaces of the
white man's world, they will do the same?</p>

<p>True that the white man, in both of these cases, has
wrested his lands from existing native tribes. But it
was also true that, in New Zealand at least, and
through Polynesia, the natives were immigrants who in
their turn imposed on yet more primitive natives, as
did the Japanese. Furthermore, no race on earth has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
been given a better opportunity to make good than has the
Maori in New Zealand. The Australoid seems on the
whole not equipped for the effort. There have been
cases of Australian blacks making good. There is the
case of the savage who after receiving an education became
a Shakespearean scholar. But the exception
only proves the rule. Furthermore, though there is
bitter opposition to any white man marrying a native
black woman in Australia&mdash;an opposition that is calling
for legal action from some quarters so that such marriage
will be in future impossible&mdash;still, the White-Australia
policy is not aimed against the blacks. These
will either take hold of themselves and make good, in
time, or will die out. Be that as it may, there is no answer
to the Asiatic demand for admission based on the
argument about the white man's plunder.</p>

<p>The only other argument is that, if this is the case,
the white man must get out of Asia. There too, it seems
to me, is a weak spot. The white man in Asia&mdash;as man
to man&mdash;does not lower the standard of the civilization
of the native; nor is he ever likely to migrate in numbers
large enough to create a problem. Only politically,
where a leeching-process exists, where native industries
are destroyed by cheap foreign products (like that of
cotton goods, which were forced upon the Indians by the
British, to the utter ruination of the Indian textiles) has
the havoc been serious. That is a real argument, and it
is up to the Asiatics so to adjust their own affairs and to
come together as to "oust" the white man,&mdash;a problem
for the natives to solve for themselves.</p>

<p>There is still another consideration. What of Japan?
Japan has national unity, she is advancing. Is she,
then, to be made an exception in the White-Australia
policy? The answer is, Japan must do as she would be
done by, an answer which will be enlarged upon in the
chapter dealing with Japan.</p>

<p>Having thus focused on the negative phases of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
discussion, let us see what is written on the inner side
of the Australasian shield. Before we can at all understand
the motives that move Australasia in the direction
she is going, and foresee the future, we shall have to know
by what channels she came to be what she is, what ideals
are parents to her being, and what ideals are her offspring.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, Britain's interest in her south
Pacific possessions have always been more or less mild.
When the question of annexing New Zealand came up
in 1839, the Duke of Wellington said in Parliament
that Great Britain already had too many colonies. It
is common knowledge that she gave them as much rope
as they would take, that when she had the opportunity
of acquiring the Samoan group in 1889 she let it slip,
and that she took the Fiji Islands only after their chief,
Thakambau, offered them in liquidation of unjust debts
to America. In other words, it was New Zealand and
Australia that held on to the mother country, instead of
the reverse. And in order to understand the spirit of
the Dominion and the Commonwealth, we must consider
the reasons for their clinging to "home."</p>

<p>Australia was first settled by men convicted of offences
against Britain's then crude sense of justice; but
New Zealand was devised as a colonial scheme under
which every feature of British life was to be transplanted.
When Europeans came to America, political and religious
freedom was sought. When Great Britain went to
New Zealand, eighty-five years ago, society was politically
and religiously free, but industrial organization
was awaiting an ambitious hand. In New Zealand it was
not, as Havelock Ellis puts it so vividly, "the roving
of a race with piratical and poetic instincts invading old
England where few stocks arrived save by stringent selection
of the sea." They did not come because of romantic
longing, nor to escape oppression and restriction. The
story of the development of New Zealand, from settle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>ment
and conquest of the Maories to the beginning of
that legislation which has made it famous, is the story of
conservatism. When the first shipload of colonists set
out from England, their prospectus was a document of
conservatism. The aim of the projectors was to transplant
every phase and station and class of English life,
to build in the other end of the world another England.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BLUE MOUNTAINS OF AUSTRALIA<br />
Seen from this side they look more like gorges</p>
</div>

<p>Doubtless the fathers of this scheme were seeking to
overcome the fear of forced transplantation which had
made of Australia a land of horror in anticipation, and
hence they spread broadcast accounts of the sort of
colony New Zealand was to be, which made it alluring.
But such are the erring tendencies of human nature that
Australia, intended to be the land of one of the worst
forms of indentured and penal servitude and the perpetuation
of unprogressiveness, set the pace for the entire
world in untried liberalism in industry, while New
Zealand, likewise advanced, has developed her latent conservatism
in regard to imperialism to a marked degree.</p>

<p>For apart from the experiments in labor legislation,
New Zealand has never lost any of the dependence on
England. She seems to be afraid of her isolation, lest,
deprived of communication with the world, she should
be forced into a condition such as that in which the
white man found the heliolithic Maories. Canada might
become a nation separate from Britain; so might Australia.
But New Zealand has not even that proximity
to a continent which made England what she is, for she
is twelve hundred miles from her nearest neighbor. In
consequence, the New Zealanders have always maintained
a strong leaning toward the homeland, whereas
in Australia early resentment alienated the settlers.
The New Zealander to-day is the exact replica of the
Englishman as we knew him; the Australian is a compromise
between an Englishman and an American. The
modern Australian on the east coast of the continent
is as little an Englishman as possible. I have heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
any number of Australians resent being called English.
The last "convict" was brought to Australia in 1840;
yet the Australians are very conscious of this stigma
on them. The other day an English engineer told me
that in Subiaco, one of the suburbs of Perth, it was impossible
for one to join the tennis-club whose grandfather
was born in Australia&mdash;lest that ignoble ancestor should
have passed on some of the "taint" to his unfortunate
offspring. Yet in the eyes of enlightened legislation, the
taint involved is of course questionable.</p>

<p><small>Photo from Brown Bros.</small></p>
<p class="caption">AUSTRALIA DENUDING HERSELF</p>
</div>


<p>It is therefore not to be wondered at that Australia
kept growing farther and farther from England. In
the early days each settlement maintained its own government,
and so great was the jealousy among the
settlements that they sought to bar one another even in
the construction of railroads. Victoria built a broad-gage
line, New South Wales, a narrower, and Queensland
the narrowest,&mdash;not mere engineering accident due
to any notion of superiority of the special line, but clearly
and openly to make communication of one with another
difficult. But by 1900 the settlements had outgrown their
childish squabbling, and they became federated into the
Commonwealth of Australia.</p>

<p>Though this brought them together within Australia,
it awoke New Zealand to the danger of being drawn into
that union against her will. "The Melbourne Age"
prophesied that in a quarter of a century they would
be federated. "The fate and destiny of Australia and
New Zealand were the same and they should be united
in the defense of these distant lands that were held by
people of the same thought and same political system."
But there never has been much love lost between them.
New Zealanders have been anathema in Australia, and
Australians hadn't a ghost of a chance of getting a job
in New Zealand. Nor was this a matter of different
standards of living, except that they both discriminated
against the Englishman. And not without reason, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
type of Englishman who set out for the Antipodes was
one who generally had nothing to sustain him at home.
To the Australasians he was virtually a foreigner, and
foreigners of any sort are few in the far South, and are
encouraged still less. Yet there is excessive pride in the
fact that something like 98 per cent. of the inhabitants
are British.</p>

<p>In view of the economic departures they have taken
from European conceptions, this would seem a paradox.
But even among the workers, the psychological effect of
"home" is apparent to the most casual observer.
Though material security has been assured by the State,
the result of much of the legislation in the Antipodes
seems to me to have been something akin to the class
system in England. The worker has become legally recognized
as a worker, he has been given a minimum wage
and protection against imposition, but any effort on the
part of labor to crystallize its ideals is still obnoxious
to the masses. There is not even any of the impulse
found among American workers toward that rise in the
social scale which is essentially bourgeois. There is a
most decided tendency to accept the status of worker in
the good old English fashion. Working-people do not
regard themselves as "gentlemen" or as "ladies," these
terms in New Zealand having the same significance they
have in the old country. Deference to one who does not
look like a laborer is pronounced, and the average workman
is more ambitious for the "gentleman" than he is for
himself. This spirit obtains much more in New Zealand
than in Australia.</p>

<p>Than dignity in labor nothing in the world could be
more worthy. But if that dignity spells merely content,
it lays society open to a renewal of the very class divisions
industrial progress has sought to remove. The laborer
is too content to remain a laborer actively to enter
the lists against injustice. And in a short time you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
those who refused to be doped by the talk of virtue in
labor on the top, and the laborer at the bottom.</p>

<p>Yet, socially and outwardly, there are not the gaps between
the classes in New Zealand that are found in Australia.
There are no great restaurants and pleasure
places for the rich. All people visit the dainty little
tea-rooms, and often workingmen come dressed in
their working-clothes, with unwashed hands. In Dunedin
the proprietor of one of the best tea-rooms handed out
little cards to laborers with "Your Patronage is Undesirable"
on them, but the public howled his practice out
of existence. This is largely because the level of life in
New Zealand is more even. The wealthy do not display
themselves over-much, and the most obvious club life is
that among the workers. Workingmen's clubs are
equipped with very good libraries and reading-rooms,
but also with tremendous circular bars fully as much
frequented as the book-shelves.</p>

<p>The result is that though, from a progressive point of
view, New Zealand is outwardly tame and sober, from
a consideration of health, the standard of life is universally
good. Any great influx of peoples with standards
of living that would of necessity demoralize this normality,
would give the country a setback which might take
generations to overcome. On the other hand, though the
present state of affairs might continue indefinitely, unless
New Zealand gains in numbers, her place among the
influential members of the Pacific Ocean nations is certain
to be strained, if not jeopardized.</p>

<p>Torn between these economic enthusiasms of a small
country and the restraining influences of a tradition that
is essentially imperialistic, New Zealand has a pretty
hard time of it. Naturally enough, she is holding on to her
beloved mother country with an excessive amount of
talk, while at the same time nibbling away at the ties that
bind her. She is in the hardest position of any of the

scorning Australia, emulating the one and trying to keep
peace with the other, realizing that proximity makes her
more than a brother of her continental kin, looking toward
America for applause and assistance, New Zealand is
shaping a policy that will probably become a patchwork
of colors,&mdash;and most interesting to look at.</p>

<p>But Australia is cutting the waters with the force of a
triple-screw turbine. And toward Australia we shall
have to look for the leadership of British policy in the
Pacific. Canada is too close to Europe and America
ever to become the real leader in the destinies of the Pacific.
The truth of this statement becomes manifest
when one watches the inner workings of the island continent.
Though New Zealand is more widely known for
its great liberalism, there is really more freedom of
thought in Australia, more freedom from traditional
thinking, more boldness of expression. That was manifest
during the war when the conscription issue came
up. The New Zealand Legislature simply enacted a
conscription measure. In Australia, the Government
tried twice to force it through by way of a referendum,
and twice it failed. William Morris Hughes, the Prime
Minister, had gone to England to attend a conference,
promising that conscription would never be proposed.
He was wedded to voluntaryism. When he returned,
Australians suspected him of having conscription up his
sleeve. There was an outburst of indignation. Australians
charged him with having had his head turned by
fawning lords and ladies at "home" and with sidling
up to a title himself. Australians are not very keen about
rank; in that matter they are more like Americans.
Hughes nearly committed political suicide by declaring
himself in favor of conscription. It is said that he was
warned by labor not to try to put it through without a
referendum. What happened then illuminates the Australian
character.</p>

<p>For weeks the country was in as wild a state as pending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
civil war could produce anywhere. The feeling was
tense. Conflicts and wrangling occurred everywhere.
Up to the last night of the discussion it seemed as though
there would be war. Then came the day of the vote.
The quiet and the orderliness was one of the greatest
boosts for democracy ever staged. Everything was
bathed in sunny restfulness. Workingmen lay upon the
grass of the public domain like seals. When they talked
it was about anything but conscription. Conscription
lost. It lost a second time the year after. Two main
factors stood out against the sending of more men to
Europe,&mdash;labor and Asia.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the referendum the coal
strike occurred. The situation became grave. To conserve
fuel for industrial purposes, the Government prohibited
the use of electricity and gas except during specified
hours. Places of business on the main streets were
lit with kerosene lamps, movies were closed, the ferry
stations stood in semi-darkness. People conversed as
though certain doom were impending. Things looked
forlorn indeed. Shops and factories were closing down,
throwing thousands out of work. One heard remarks
about things heading for a revolution.</p>

<p>Australia is reputed to have done wonders in the way
of solving the problems of capital and labor, but there
are as many strikes in that Commonwealth as in any
other state. The country is crystallizing quickly and is
bound to become more and more conservative. Despite
the worthy democracy to be found there, every public
utterance seemed to bear itself as though made by a lord.
One is constantly aware of the presence of the crown,
even though it has been removed, like the sense of pressure
behind one's ears after having taken off one's
spectacles. For notwithstanding its democracy, Australia
is bound up in the monarchy. Revolution was
hinted at every now and then, but at its mention one also
heard the creaking of the bones of empire. It was evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>dent
and clear, though hardly spoken. One felt the
security which comes from the accumulation of tradition
and custom, but it was not comfortable. Even in Australia
change seems to be regarded as synonymous with
destruction. A marvelous structure, this British Empire,
and fit for the residence of any human being,&mdash;but
not an American. He is too dynamic, too restless, too
eager for creation.</p>

<p>And here is where we arrive at the point of meeting
and of parting in our relations with Australia. America
has determined upon keeping the country "white"
against the invasion of Asia. So has Australia. But
America has the inclusive tendencies of an empire; Australia
the exclusive. America is heterogeneous; Australia
is homogeneous. American strikes are regarded
as importations, but what about the strikes in Australia?
America has a population of 110,000,000 in an area but
a little larger than Australia, while Australia has only a
paltry 4,500,000. America is trying to amalgamate the
diverse races it already has without taking in such people
as the Asiatics, whose racial characters are so unyielding.
But Australia is herself unyielding. Homogeneous
as her population is, she has great difficulty in
keeping it from disagreement. With a vast region not
likely to be touched by labor in generations, Australia
uses the same arguments against outsiders coming in as
does America in regions already well developed.</p>

<p>Keeping Australia "white" is the keynote of all Australian
politics. For this reason half of the leaders
waged war against Germany; while to keep Australia
white, the other half stayed conscription. Labor is at
the bottom of the "white" Australia policy. The most
serious problem the country has to face is her insufficient
population. Yet what labor is to be found there receives
no more consideration than anywhere else in the world.
It is no better off than elsewhere. There is less poverty
simply because poverty is synonymous with over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>-population.
To protect itself against invasion of cheap
(not necessarily Asiatic) labor, Australia passed the Immigration
Restriction Act of 1901. To speak of restricting
immigration into a country containing only four and
a half million seems suicidal, but Australia went at it
without any trepidation and declared for the exclusion
from "immigration into the Commonwealth ... any person
who fails to pass the dictation test; that is to say,
who, when an officer dictates to him not less than fifty
words in any prescribed language in the presence of the
officer" fails to pass in the judgment of the immigration
officer. This is the crux of the Act; other than that, restriction
is placed only on those diseased or incapable.
In other words, this restriction places a person failing in
the test on a level with the criminal, lunatic, and the leper.
It is obviously a snare, for it means that an officer may
spring any language he may choose on an immigrant.
He may ask a Frenchman to write Greek, or a Greek
Spanish, failure to comply giving the officer the power to
exclude the applicant. The law has kept Australia
white, but with pallor rather than purity.</p>

<p>Veiled and unveiled, this White-Australia policy was
at the bottom of the failure of conscription. The spirit
which dominated both camps was fear of invasion.
Argued the pro-conscriptionist: "If we do not stand behind
the empire and the Allies in this war, Prussia or
whoever may become her ally in future will swoop down
upon us." Argued the anti-conscriptionist: "If that is
the danger, then let us keep our men at home to protect
us against this possible peril." The antis were more
open. They pictured an invasion following the sending
of men to Europe, and pointed to the importation of
coolies for labor in Europe. One member of Parliament
was fined a thousand dollars and made to enter into
"cognizance and comply with the provisions of the Regulation"
because he specified whom they were afraid of,&mdash;Japan.
And to add grist to their mill, a hundred na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>tives
of the island of Malta (British subjects, mind you)
appeared at the beautiful front door of Australia, Sydney
Harbor, and asked for admission. They did not land.
Even Indians are excluded, a deposit of five hundred dollars
being required of any admitted, to guarantee his
return. A transport has been fitted out in Java with
native labor, but Australian workers refused to load it
till the fittings were torn out and done over by Australian
labor.</p>

<p>Now, the White-Australia policy is, if you care to
stretch a point, a humane attempt to avoid conflict. The
Australians say to themselves and to the world: "We
would rather call you names across the sea than scratch
your eyes or pull your ears over a wooden fence." They
point to the American Civil War and the present problem
in the South as an example. They wish to save themselves
future operations by avoiding the cancer and are
willing to bear the burden of retarded development for
this promised peace. Let us see how it worked out.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in 1915, 890 Germans
were admitted to Australia, and only 423 Japanese; in
1914, 3,395 Germans and 387 Japanese. The number of
Germans for the two years previous was virtually the
same, whereas that of Japanese fluctuated from 698 in
1912 to 822 in 1913, and 387 in 1914. From 1908 to 1915
the Germans entered in increasing numbers, while the
Japanese decreased. Chinese gained admission in vastly
greater number than the Japanese, exceeding them by
1,500 and 2,000 yearly. On the whole the preponderance
of arrivals over the departure was seldom excessive,
most of the steamers from the south bound for the Orient
being taken up by returning Asiatics. With the vast
regions of the island continent uninhabited and untouched,
this movement of Orientals is only evidence of
the check the Government keeps on invasion. The fallacy
in the White-Australia policy is obvious. Its psychological
significance was pointed to above,&mdash;a tendency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
on the part of Australians, though politically democrats,
to revert to habits of thought inherited from England.
England is an island kingdom, but the Englishman cannot
forget this even when he has taken up his home on
a vast continent like Australia. In this day and age of
steel ships and submarines, with possibilities of the airship
clear before us, for any one to think in an insular
way is to lack the common sense of a King Canute. Australia
has shown that even with an enemy recognized
and fought she has been unable to remain unified in
thought, yet she thinks that merely by excluding the
Asiatic she will be able to maintain her integrity. Capital
in Australia would be willing to admit the Oriental
in order to reduce the cost of labor; but as soon as he
becomes a factor in commerce&mdash;as in the case of the
Chinese furniture-makers who exploit Chinese laborers
and undersell Australian furniture manufacturers&mdash;Capital
becomes wroth and shouts for the exclusion of
the coolie. Labor, on the other hand, swaggering about
the brotherhood of man and the common cause of labor
throughout the world, becomes just as nationalistic when
"foreign" labor threatens to undersell it. True that it
would be easy enough to establish a minimum wage by
law, so that no Chinese would be allowed to receive less
than that wage for his work, but the principle doesn't
work out so easily. Even with a minimum wage and an
eight-hour day, the Chinese with his intense application
to his job and his manner of living would threaten the
white man. But have we not the same difficulty even
among a given number of white men, where some are
ready to undersell others? Australia, the experiment-station
for labor legislation, is the last country where one
would expect to find the exclusiveness which she condemns
so vigorously. She has shown herself exclusive
in her discrimination against the English workingman;
she has even been exclusive in her attitude toward her
neighbor, New Zealand (an exclusiveness, which is recip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>rocated,
of course); and finally and foremost, she is
exclusive of Asiatic and colored people.</p>

<p>This exclusiveness has left a continent with barely
the fringe of it scratched. To people like the Japanese,
Chinese and Indians, this must indeed seem the height
of selfishness. True, that sparse as her population is,
Australia has done more to better the condition of her
people than has Japan or China; and there is the rub.
That mere excessive breeding gives a nation a right to
invade other lands is a principle that no decent-minded
man could tolerate for a moment. Only people to whom
woman is merely a breeding-machine would advance
such an argument. And in the chapter on Japan and the
Far East I shall elucidate the basic facts in that contention
for the elimination of a White-Australia policy.</p>

<p>From the Australian point of view, though admitting
that hardships are bound to result, admitting that ethically
discrimination is unprogressive, the country is
faced by the danger of sheer numbers. Idealistically the
Australian policy is wrong. Individually, those of us
who know the Japanese and the Chinese would just as
soon live next door to them as to any other human beings.
But as long as numbers are the racial ideal of the East,
there is no solution that would not undermine quality
if quality did not defend itself against quantity. I am
ready to admit that there are many Australians who
are as inferior to the Chinese as the coolie is to us. But
the Australasian has one virtue: he does not breed like
the Oriental.</p>

<p>The problem of assimilation and Australianization is
intricate and sometimes extremely unjust. There is the
case of the young Chinese boy born and brought up in
Port Darwin, North Australia. In every way he is an
Australian citizen. To further his education and westernization,
he came to America to study at Harvard, and
here fell in love with a Chinese student born in Boston.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Now, she is an American citizen. They are to be married.
He has every reason for wishing to return to
Port Darwin with his wife. But, says the Australian
Immigration Law, you can't come in because you're a
Chinese. "But I'm an American Citizen, and the wife
of an Australian," she argues. "That doesn't matter.
We exclude Indians, who are British subjects, from entering
Australia, and we intend to exclude you. Australia
is the only country in the world in which the white
race is still free to expand, and we intend to keep it free
for them." "What is America going to do about it?"
I asked my informer. "What can she do? The only
thing she could do would be to come to a clash of arms
with us, and we intend to let the Chinese do their own
fighting if they want to. We won't let Japanese who
are American-born citizens enter Australia; we may seem
a bit piggish about it, but we intend to hold to our own
nevertheless." This question was up for the British
Minister to decide upon, but at the time of writing no
decision has yet been arrived at.</p>

<p>That injustice such as the above is bound to result is
obvious. But for generations to come the onus rests on
the Orientals, and on those white men who would profit
by either cheap or untiring laborers whose minds ask
for nothing, and whose bodies are content with little.</p>

<p>Though Australia's contribution to the intellectual welfare
of the world has as yet been slim, the advance in
political and economic thought has been exceedingly
worth while. The freedom of the individual to go his
way in life, to develop the best that is in him, the standard
of general welfare and the quality of life as a whole
so far excels the average of Oriental social life that Australasia
is justified in trying to prevent the dilution of
its concentrated comfort. We all know and admit that
both China and Japan have civilizations, intellectual and
artistic, the like of which might well be emulated in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
West. But beneath it all is the dreadful waste of human
life for which China and Japan must give answer before
demanding of the West certain physical and material advantages
which we have.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>JAPAN AND ASIA</small></h3>


<p>When I completed the final section of my book
"Japan: Real and Imaginary," last year, and
sent it to the publisher, I was not a little worried lest the
movement of events in the Far East proceed so rapidly
that the cart upon which I was riding slip from under me
and leave me to rejoin the earth as best I could. So
fast did things run that I thought surely there would be
a revolution in Japan, or at least universal manhood suffrage,
and that without doubt Japan would withdraw
from Shantung. I am afraid I shall have to confess
that the wish was father to the thought. So far nothing
has happened in that intricate island empire seriously to
affect any of the generalizations in that book. Nor have
any criticisms from my Japanese friends come forward
so that I might now be able to alter my position in any
way.</p>

<p>However, enough has happened to make it necessary
for me to extend and enlarge upon some of the phases
of the Japanese situation as they now obtain. In my
former book I handled Japan as an integer, avoiding implications.
Here I shall attempt to show how the Japanese
phase of the problem of the Pacific affects the three
important elements round the Pacific,&mdash;America, Australasia,
and Asia. Under that head I shall have to begin
where I left off in "Japan: Real and Imaginary," with
the question of emperor-worship and its natural offspring,
Pan-Asianism and the so-called Monroe Doctrine
of Asia; with the ingrowing phases of it, democracy in
Japan, and the Open Door without; with Japan's new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
mandates and what she is doing with them; with the
fortification of the Bonin Islands and the Pescadores.</p>

<p>At the very outset, let me crystallize in one short paragraph
the essence of the whole situation. We have in
Japan now a heterogeneous nation whose ideals are essentially
those of imperialism, the political grip on the
people being based on the worship of the emperor. The
outward consequence of this is that the entire nation is
fairly united upon the questions that affect the nation as
a whole, such as Pan-Asianism, the leadership of Asia.
But if that were all, Japanese rulers would have things
pretty much their own way. This strange consequence
results, however,&mdash;that having been stimulated to feeling
that a Japanese is the most superior person on earth,
the populace, in this pride, is demanding greater recognition
for themselves as individuals. Hence that which the
military and naval parties in Japan win in their hold
upon the people through increased pride of race, they lose
in the enhanced difficulty which comes from a restive
population. Added to which are the numerous alien elements
that aggression has inherited,&mdash;a rebellious Korea
and Formosa, a boycotting China, and a native element
that sees itself being flaunted by world powers and unable
to obtain recognition of racial equality.</p>

<p>It is Japan's misfortune that she is still unable to
live down her reputation. With all her might she is
trying to stand up to the world as a man, and not as a
pretty boy such as she has been regarded heretofore.
Hence, it is necessary, that after having paragraphed
the make-up of Japan, I do the same with the attitude
of the world toward Japan. Wherever I have gone I
have been asked a certain type of question that seems to
me to hold the mirror up to Japan. The questions are generally
these: What business is it of ours, after all, what
Japan does in Asia? Isn't it only the conceit of the
white man that makes him regard himself as superior
to the Japanese? Isn't it true that the Japanese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
haven't any room for their surplus population? Or, the
more knowing, those who have read up on the subject&mdash;like
the man who signed a contract with a publisher to
produce four boys' books at once, one of which was on
Shintoism in Japan&mdash;assume this attitude: "Let them
adore their emperors; it's a charming little peculiarity."
There is still a third group. It belongs to the
adolescent class, to the age of boys who threaten to lick
other boys with their little finger, or "I'll fight you with
my right hand tied behind my back," and has been fed by
the romancers who portrayed everything Japanese as
petite and charming. The <i>Miles Gloriosus</i>, suffering
from political second childhood, asserts: "America could
wipe the floor with Japan with one hand, just as she could
Ecuador." This statement was made by an Englishman
with remarkably wide international experience.</p>

<p>Now, until Japan lives down this reputation she will
be forced to make as big a showing of her might as is
safe, and until then we shall doubtless have ample reason
for shouting for an increased navy and an increased
army. In other words, as long as we continue to publish
the impression that Japan need not be regarded seriously,
so long will Japan have to continue to convey the impression
that she might become a menace. To deny that
Japan is a disconcerting problem is to stick one's head
in the sand. But Japan is no more of a menace to us
than we are to her. Japan is not simply going to walk
across the Pacific and slap us in the face. If any such
catastrophe takes place over there, it will be a conflict.
"A conflict supposes a violent collision, a meeting of
force against force; the unpremeditated meeting of one
or more persons in a violent or hostile manner" with
another, according to Crabb. On the other hand, it is
equally true that those who urge and stimulate war talk
with Japan are playing into the hands of special interests
that are too narrow in their thinking and too broad in
their avarice, and make war inevitable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>There is only one solution, and that is the presentation
of facts. But facts alone are sometimes worse than figures.
They lie like a trooper. Hence we are in the habit
of saying: It is an honest fact. Facts are the most irresponsible
things in the world, and without the motives and
the spirit that underlie every circumstantial thing in life,
they are the source of all conflict and all sorrow. Therefore,
let us consider the questions that appear to be typical
enough to clarify the situation, but with the motives
and spiritual factors included in the answer.</p>

<p>First of all, then, is it really any of our business what
Japan does in Asia? I shall have to split this question
in two. The "our" side of the matter will have to be
answered in the succeeding chapter on America in this
Pacific Triangle. Here I shall handle it by inverting it.
Is it any of Japan's business what interest we take in
Asia? This may sound like a pugnacious question, but
it is asked with all due respect to Japan. It raises the
question of the Open Door in China, of Pan-Asianism,
of the misnamed Monroe Doctrine of Asia. We have
come to a new stage in the history of the world. People
with a developed sense of justice no longer admit that a
man may declare himself monarch of all he surveys without
consideration of the rights of the inhabitants of the
"surveyed" areas. When, during the war, everything
was being done to placate Japan, a certain "understanding"
was reached between Secretary Lansing and Viscount
Ishii. While declaring for the Open Door it acknowledged
the precedence of propinquity over distance,
of time, place, and relationship. That is, it admitted
that Japan was nearer the continent of Asia geographically
than was America. A very remarkable observation
it was. Certainly had that not been put in black
and white, "understanding" would never have been possible.
But what was the result of that "understanding"?
Japan immediately translated it into a "Monroe
Doctrine of Asia." Here, then, was a fact. Japan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
most decidedly is nearer Asia than are we. Ergo, Japan
has the right to set herself up as the god and little
Father of China, to declare the Mikado Doctrine of
Asia. But is there any parallel whatsoever? Not only
no parallel, but an apparent contradiction in the use
of the Monroe Doctrine from the American angle; for
that pronouncement involved non-interference in European
or foreign affairs. If we adhere strictly to the
Monroe Doctrine we have no right to set any limitations
for Japan. Our concern is only with the Americas. Even
the amount of understanding involved in the Ishii-Lansing
agreement is in violation of our doctrine of isolation.
On the other hand, we virtually pledged ourselves to keep
our own hands off South America, Hence, the Monroe
Doctrine, if applied to Asia by Japan, would mean the denouncement
of the Twenty-one Demands made on China
in 1915, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shantung
and Siberia, the return of independence to Korea,&mdash;and
then the demand on the part of Japan that all European
powers abstain from further extension of their influence
on the continent of Asia. If ever a Monroe Doctrine
of Asia was really declared, it was in the principles of
Hay in his Open-Door policy. If Japan should set herself
up as the guardian of Asia in this wise, she would never
raise the question of whether we have any business in Asia
or not. It would not be necessary. And Japan would be
able to enjoy the fruits of propinquity to her heart's
content. Then Japan would truly be the sponsor for a
doctrine that could be called the Mikado's Doctrine of
Asia and its worth would recommend itself to the respect
and admiration of the world. But this, of course, is a
dream, and in the words of a worthy Japanese author
who "deplored" in his book "the gross diplomatic
blunder which Japan made in 1915 in her dealings with
China" and the "atrocities perpetrated in the attempt
to crush the Korean uprising": "Manifestly, the dawn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
of the millennium is still far away. We have to make
the best of the world as it is."</p>

<p>Into these criticisms of Japan's foreign policies one
could read the usual white man's conceit,&mdash;asking that
a yellow man make such sacrifices as no white man has
ever made. There is nothing further from my mind.
There is only a groping down into the depths of Japanese
practices to discover, if possible, a real basis for
the justification of her Pan-Asiatic pretensions.</p>

<p>To me, Oriental civilization is something to conjure
with.</p>

<p>There is in the Far East more art and beauty than
there is in America. When Europe was so poor as to
make the Grand Moguls laugh at the simple presents
which Englishmen brought them, to remark with scorn
and truth that nothing in Europe compared with the silks
and gold and silver of the East, the white man was humble.
He wandered all over the world in search of riches
which were unknown to him except by hearsay. His
dominions never extended over such vast spaces as
seemed mere checker-boards to Oriental monarchs. But
the white man had his ships, his latent genius, and these
he has developed to where his realms now so far outstrip
the realms of old as thought outstrips creation.
With these the white man has secured for himself a place
in the world which the brown and the yellow man now
greatly envy. But the Asiatics have much to look back
upon and be proud of.</p>

<p>How much of this splendor is Japan's? A great deal!
But not as much as the splendor of China, nor as much
as that of India. Japan is to the East what England is
to Europe. Japan is building up her ships and her material
arts to such an extent that she is destined to wield
and does now partly wield the same influence in Asia that
England wields in Europe. But is that to be her sole contribution?
Is that to justify her place as leader of
Asia? Let us see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>In Europe to-day there is no crowned head who really
rules. The monarch, where he does exist, is the memorial
symbol of the nation's past. But the basis of rule is the
people. The extent to which democracy exists in fact is
not for this chapter to discuss. The slogan of rulership
is democracy. Even China calls itself a republic.
Round the Pacific alone are three great republican or
democratic countries&mdash;Australia, New Zealand, America&mdash;whose
people are reaching for greater and greater independence
in the working out of their own destinies.</p>

<p>But what have we in Japan? We have a monarchy
with a "constitutional" form of government. The monarch
is said to have held his power from the beginning
of time. He is literally regarded as a descendant of the
gods who created Japan,&mdash;which was then the world entire.
The myth of his origin would not be very different
from any other myth of the origins of rulers, were it
not for the recent developments in the history of Japan.
At the time of the restoration of the previous emperor
to power, it was decided by the rebellious daimyo that
the long-neglected mikado, he who for hundreds of years
had had absolutely no say in the government of his
lands, should be restored to power. That is to say, because
there was no one daimyo who could himself take
the leadership and become shogun, they determined to
rule with the tenno as nominal leader, but themselves
as the real rulers. Other than in the superstitious reverence
of the ignorant masses for the symbol of the
tenno&mdash;whose person they had never seen&mdash;that lowly
illustrious one might just as well have been non-existent
for all the say he had in his country's affairs. So far, the
situation might not be different from that in England,
but England's Parliament is in the control of the Commons,
while Japan's Diet&mdash;both upper and lower houses&mdash;is
at the mercy of the cabinet, which, though ostensibly
responsible to the emperor, is actually in the control
of the genro and the military and naval clans. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
worship of the emperor, on the other hand, is made part
of the political function, the better to cow the masses
into reverential obedience to the wishes of the actual
rulers.</p>

<p>The basis for this theocratical grip on the people is
Shintoism. With the Restoration in 1868, Shintoism,
that ancestor-worshiping cult, was revived as the spiritual
core of the new empire; Buddhism was sent packing,
and all the cunning of pseudo-historians was resorted to
to bolster up this effete and primitive national ideal.</p>

<p>"Let them worship their old emperor," say some,
largely those with a love of pageantry in their unconscious.
And no one could raise an argument against
this if that was where it ended. If it merely meant the
binding together in a communal nationalism the thought
and devotion of the people, it would be a desirable performance.
But the natural result of an artificially
stimulated nationalism based on a myth and a deception
is that it becomes proselytic in its tendencies. It is not
satisfied with its native influence, but begins to reach
out. In other words, it takes upon itself the duty of
making the entire world one, just as religion and democracy
seek to convert the world. And Shintoism is a
short step to Pan-Asianism. Pan-Asianism is the logical
consequence of Shintoism.</p>

<p>What is Shintoism? In this connection, none is more
authoritative than Basil Hall Chamberlain, Emeritus
Professor of Japanese and Philology at the Imperial
University of Tokyo, and author of numerous scientific
works on Japan. In "The Invention of a New Religion"
he says (page 6):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Agnostic Japan is teaching us at this very hour how religions are
sometimes manufactured for a special end&mdash;to observe practical worldly
purposes.</p>

<p>Mikado-worship and Japan-worship&mdash;for that is the new Japanese
religion&mdash;is, of course, no spontaneously generated phenomenon.
Every manufacture presupposes a material out of which it is made,
every present a past on which it rests. But the twentieth-century
Japanese religion of loyalty and patriotism is quite new, for in it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
pre-existing ideas have been sifted, altered, freshly compounded, turned
to new uses, and have found a new center of gravity.... Shinto, a
primitive nature cult, which had fallen into discredit, was taken out of
its cupboard and dusted.</p></div>

</div>

<p>Thus Shintoism, a cult without any code of morals,
in which nature was worshiped in primitive fashion, was
made the basis of the national ideal. There is nothing
in Shintoism that might with the greatest possible stretch
of imagination become the ideal of any other nation in
the world. However much Japan might assume the
economic leadership of Asia, it would never be because
she could obtain a following for her Shinotistic ideals.
"Democracy" has become a rallying cry even to the
Japanese, but there is nothing in Shintoism that might
counteract that appeal.</p>

<p>"What about Bushido?" Japanese will ask. Regarding
this, it is also well to read what Professor Chamberlain
has to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As to Bushido, so modern a thing is it that neither Kaempfer, Siebold,
Satow, nor Rein&mdash;all men knowing their Japan by heart&mdash;ever once
allude to it in their voluminous writings. The cause of their silence
is not far to seek: Bushido was unknown until a decade or two ago!
<i>The very word appears in no dictionary, native or foreign, before the
year 1900.</i> Chivalrous individuals of course existed in Japan, as in
all countries at every period; but Bushido as an institution or a code
of rules, has never existed. The accounts given of it have been fabricated
out of whole cloth, chiefly for foreign consumption. An analysis
of medieval Japanese history shows that the great feudal houses, so
far from displaying an excessive idealism in the matter of fealty
to one emperor, one lord, or one party, had evolved the eminently
practical plan of letting different members take different sides, so
that the family as a whole might come out as winner in any event,
and thus avoid the confiscation of its lands. Cases, no doubt, occurred
of devotion to losing causes&mdash;for example, to Mikados in disgrace; but
they were less common than in the more romantic West.</p></div>

<p>And when it is further taken into consideration that
Bushido, or the so-called code of the samurai, was the
ideal of a special class, a class that held itself aloof from
contact with the <i>heimin</i>, or common people, whom it at
at all times treated with contempt, and cut down even
for no other reason than that of trying the edge of a
new sword, one sees how utterly unacceptable it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
be to peoples of other races and nations asked to come
to the support of its standards. And according to one
Japanese spokesman in America, only by methods that
"had the appearance of browbeating her to submission
by brandishing the sword" was China brought to accept
the infamous Twenty-one Demands.</p>

<p>I search my memory and experience earnestly trying
to find a basis for Japan's leadership in Asia that is
not materialistic, and I cannot find any. Energy and
intellectual capacity Japan has. Her present leadership
in practical affairs is a great credit to her. In time, when
greater leisure will become the possession of her teeming
millions, there is doubtless going to appear much more
that is fine and valuable in the fabric of the race. For
Japan has fire. Her people are an excitable, flaming
people who may burst out in a spasmodic revulsion
against their commercialization. But for the time being,
her only right to a voice in the destinies of Asia is found
in her industrial leadership of the East, but that is a
leadership which is fraught with more menace to Japan
than to the world.</p>

<p>Let us review hastily the results of this pre&euml;minence.
From being one of the most admired nations in the world,
Japan has suddenly become the object of almost universal
suspicion. To a very great extent, commercial jealousy
is playing its part in this change. But that is not
all, by any means. There is as much enmity between
British and American traders in the Far East as there
is between Japanese and American, or any other two
groups of nationals.</p>

<p>But the animosity toward Japan is deeper than that
of mere trade. It lies at the bottom of much of the
seeming equivocation of Japan's best foreign friends.
I was talking recently to one of the leading members
of the Japan Society in New York, and said of myself
that I deplored being regarded as anti-Japanese in some
quarters, because I was not. "But," spoke up this Jap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>anophile,
"the majority of the members of the Japan
Society are anti-Japanese, or pro-Chinese, if you will."
They are trying their best to defend Japan, it would
seem, and to cement bad relations with good, but the
result is that the ground of many sympathizers of Japan
is constantly shifting, though perhaps unconsciously. It
is due, I presume, to the disappointment of people in that,
having regarded Japan as worthy of their sympathy and
adoration, they are now finding that all is not as well as it
might be.</p>

<p>Then there is that peculiar twist to Japanese psychology
that somewhat unnerves the Westerner. This is not
a language difficulty, though it is best illustrated by a
linguistic example. A Canadian in Kobe told me that he
felt a strange shifting in his own mentality as a result
of the study of Japanese, something queer entered his
thinking processes. This is of course absurd as a concrete
argument, but it indicates that which I am striving to
uncover in the Japanese mind and method which works
upon the Western mind, and puzzles and perplexes the
white man in his relations with the Japanese. And in
the wider fields of Japanese life, it makes us tighten our
muscles when we survey and weigh the expressions of
the best Japanese minds, expressions by which they hope,
earnestly no doubt, to better our relations with them.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the growth of democracy. As I have
said, when I left Japan it was with a sense of revolution
impending. Agitation had got so far out of bonds that it
seemed nothing but complete collapse of the Government
could follow. The agitation has gone on, violent expressions
are often used, democracy is hailed and Japanese
"propagandists" abroad assert with a boldness that is
inexplicable their faith in democracy and their hatred of
militarism and bureaucracy. But democracy in Japan
is virtually non-existent. Japan is to-day no nearer liberalism
than Russia was in 1905. One dreads to make
parallels, when one thinks how it was that Russia got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
rid of her czars, that the dreadful war in Europe alone
made it possible for a change in the Russian Government.
Is it going to take such a war to accomplish this
in Japan? Some of the most ardent Japanese in America
boldly answer, "Yes."</p>

<p>Again, China! Many Japanophiles will say that our
love of China is based on our trade with her, and her
own weakness to resist it, while at the same time pointing
to our enormous trade with Japan as proof of friendship.
That is false. True, that, compared with Japan,
China is no "menace" to America. But though China is
the root of our problem, there is something in the nature
of the true Oriental that makes him charming, jovial,
childlike and lovable. Japan is, of course, not truly
Oriental. Japan is essentially Malay, mixed with some
Oriental and a little Caucasian. But in the two and a half
years of my residence in Japan I did not once come
across a white person who had that same unexplainable
admiration for the native that is the outstanding characteristic
of white men in China. Be that as it may&mdash;and
that is, after all, a personal matter&mdash;that which enters
into the Sino-Japanese problem is the attitude of the
Japanese to the Chinese. None was so ready to exalt the
Japanese as were the foreigners after the Boxer uprising
in 1900. Then the Japanese were hailed for their helpfulness
and their dexterity. But the manner of Japanese in
China to-day goes against the grain of people. They
ask themselves constantly: For nearly seven years
Japan has promised faithfully to withdraw from Shantung,
and her promises are as earnestly being expressed
to-day. Is it, then, so hard to remove troops? Not so
hard to move them in, it seems.</p>

<p>Those of us who listen to Japanese promises are from
Missouri. Japan in conjunction with the Allies sent
troops to Siberia to "protect" Vladivostok. Each of the
Allies were supposed to send seven thousand troops.
Japan sent close to one hundred thousand. She has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
earnestly promised to withdraw them ever since. Why
are they not withdrawn?</p>

<p>Then comes the hardest thing of all to reconcile with
her promises,&mdash;Japan's actions in Korea. It is easy to
sentimentalize over the fate of nations. Korea's independence
is a slogan that doesn't mean much, though
Korea claims four thousand years of civilized existence.
An independent Korea doesn't offer very great promise,
even if one is constrained to sympathize with her aspiration
for independence. Korea might just as well be an
integer of the Japanese Empire. She had ample time in
which to expel foreign intriguers and denounce her own
grafters, for the sake of independence, years ago. But
what has that to do with Japanese atrocities in Korea?
What has that to do with the action of Japanese merchants
who, according to Japan's own envoy to Korea,
Count Inouye, acted worse than conquerors. Count
Inouye said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All the Japanese are overbearing and rude in their dealings with
the Koreans.... The Japanese are not only overbearing but violent
in their attitude towards the Koreans. When there is the slightest
misunderstanding, they do not hesitate to employ their fists. Indeed,
it is not uncommon for them to pitch Koreans into the river, or to
cut them down with swords. If merchants commit these acts of violence,
the conduct of those who are not merchants may well be imagined.
They say: "We have made you an independent nation, we
have saved you from the Tonghaks, whoever dares to reject our advice
or oppose our actions is an ungrateful traitor." Even military coolies
use language like that towards the Koreans.<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_5" id="Footnote_1_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_5"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In <i>Nichi, Nichi Shimnun</i>, quoted by Professor Longford in <i>The Story
of Korea</i>, pp. 137-338.</p></div>

<p>The atrocities in Korea committed by the Japanese
in the uprising of 1919 would parallel the most exaggerated
reports of what happened to Belgium. Yet America's
treaty with the Kingdom of Korea, ignored when
Japan annexed the empire in 1910, has never been abrogated.
Where is Bushido in Japan, that it does not rise
in indignation at these atrocities? It has done so, but
so faintly that it might just as well have saved itself the
effort. Apology after apology, but atrocity following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
each apology with the same inexorable ruthlessness of
fate. Likewise, the massacres in Nikolajevks, and Chien-tao
are still unanswered. They require a public apology
of some sort.</p>

<p>If I am charged with deliberately selecting things derogatory
to Japan, I can only say that nothing, in my
mind, that Japan may have done for the good of Korea
and of the world, none of the virtues which Japan possesses
can ever counterbalance these crimes. Yet intelligent
Japanese write:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fortunately, a change of heart has come to the Mikado's Government
... there will be established ... a School Council to discuss
matters relating to education. [No mention is made of the up-rooting
of the native language.] The step may be slow, but the goal is sure.
Korea's union with Japan was consummated after the bitter experience
of two sanguinary wars and <i>the mature deliberation of the best minds
of the two peoples</i>.</p></div>

<p>The italics are mine. Who were these minds? No
mention is made of the assassination of the Korean
Queen by Japanese, later "exonerated." In other
words, now that the lion has eaten the lamb he is going
to tell the lamb the best way in which he can be digested,
for they are "discussing matters" to their mutual advantage.</p>

<p>One is inclined to become bitter in the rehearsal of
such facts, the feeling being induced by the evasive
apologies of rhetoricians. But these outstanding facts
must be faced if any true judgment can be formed of
Japan's position in the Far East: If it is her aim merely
to dominate in Asia, then Japan has set out to do it masterfully.
But if the leadership of the yellow race is her
aim, if Pan-Asianism means the uplifting of all Oriental
races now under the heel of the white race, then
Japan has chosen the most unfortunate line of action.
She is running an obstacle race in which the silken garments
of Bushido are likely to suffer considerable wear
and tear. Credit Japan deserves for her administrative
ability. Certain it is that no country in the Orient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
to-day has the same capacity to rule that Japan has. In
international affairs, Japan has proved herself a match
for the shrewdest diplomats of the Western world. It
is not to be marveled at that the yellow races should be
willing to yield her her position and her prestige.
Thousands of Chinese who could not afford a Western
education are now being educated in the universities of
Japan; many Indians are doing likewise. In the simple
matter of road-building, Japan has done what few Oriental
countries seem to have the capacity to do. It is
natural that the Orient should look to Japan for leadership
in government and industry, in direction and help.
But is Japan giving it?</p>

<p>The experiences of Tagore in Japan are not reassuring.
He turned from Japan as from a gross imitator
of the West from which he had escaped. He expressed
keen disappointment at what he saw in modern Japan.
In the "New York Times," recently, there was an article
by a Chinese called "The Uncivilized United States,"
the thesis of the writer being that the Americans lacked
the gentlemanliness of the English. The Chinese was
obviously a great admirer of the Japanese and repeated
over and over again that the Tokugawas were great
rulers because they advocated the rule by "tenderness of
heart"; but he, too, despaired of the modern Japan, of its
great industries and little heart.</p>

<p>That, of course, has been the oft-repeated criticism
of America from older countries, and need not discourage
Japan. But Japan is making that greater error of
believing that a world which has won civil liberty and
enlightenment after so many centuries of strife, has
builded for the masses at least a semblance of economic
freedom and democracy, is going to yield all this
blithely to an antiquated ideal of Oriental imperialism
that has not even the virtues of Oriental mysticism to
recommend it.</p>

<h4>1</h4>

<p>Johnny Appleseed, whose real name was John
Chapman, ended his career at Fort Wayne, Indiana,
in 1847. Step by step he made his way over the wilderness,
winning the good-will of the pioneers and the devotion
of the Indians, and planting apple-seeds which time
nourished into orchards. Johnnie Appleseed has been
glorified by Vachel Lindsay,&mdash;and with him, not a little
of the richness of life that went into the make-up of
America.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Johnny Appleseed died in Indiana, at
the early age of seventy-two. Had he lived twice as
long he would most likely have reached the coast. By
most he was regarded as rather a queer character, but
there were men who felt the current of greatness in his
being, and to-day Johnny Appleseed might well be hailed
as the symbol of America.</p>

<p>For if the virtue of England lay in that process of
selection which was the result of "the roving of a race
with piratical and poetic instincts invading old England
where few stocks arrived save by stringent selection of
the sea," how much more is the hardihood of pioneering
the very bone and marrow of America. For the sifting
process here did not end merely by the crossing of the
Atlantic. To those who broke through the fears of the
Atlantic, lanced the gathering ills of Europe, that Eastern
ocean was only the symbol of a tradition. The way
has been kept open by the passage of millions of men and
women and children who, year after year, for four cen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>turies,
have been invading young America. But what is
that coming compared with the arduous reaching out
across the wilderness of this vast continent itself, a
reaching that left its mile-stones in the form of log cabins,
graves, and roaring cities. Following the trade-winds or
beating up against the billows of the Northern seas was
a joyous pastime compared with the windless waiting and
tireless pressing on of the prairie schooner. The conquest
of the mountains, of the Mississippi, of the treeless
plains, of the desert, and of the rocky barriers in the
farthest West is a story replete with tragic episodes,
and it is destined to become the dominating tradition of
America.</p>

<p>It is a strange story, and because it was essentially so
lowly in its early impulse, because it was seemingly a
secondary phenomenon, snobs and cynics dispose of it
with indifference. The movement westward was undertaken
by men of small means and little culture. Pathetic
in its simple requirements, seeking fortunes that always
lay on the fringe of fortune, moving on with a restlessness
that seemed to despise rest and ease, it still left in
its wake sorrows that approached tragedy but never
felt it. If "Main Street" is a necessary corrective,
"The Son of the Middle Border" is the crystallization
of an unconscious ideal. This westward movement is a
vivid rehearsal of a belated migration that tells the tale
of man's first yielding to the mobile impulse in his nature,
an impulse that has made of him the conqueror of
the globe. These thousands of Johnny Appleseeds were
not utilitarian seekers after wealth alone; in them was
the unconscious mother principle yielding to the forces
that were fathering a new race.</p>

<p>And that new race has come. Centuries of arduous
trial and tribulation have molded it. Go where you will,
except for some slight differences in tonal expression,
there is one people. Beneath their Americanism are the
crude complexes resulting from a war between refinement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
and the unkind forces of nature. The pioneers had all
known what civilization meant, but circumstances
thwarted their inclinations. They brought with them a
respect for woman which no other people had known
so well. Primitive and Oriental people&mdash;and many
European races of to-day&mdash;do not have the same exalted
notion of woman, simply because they have developed
along with women whose functions of life were determined
by the savage circumstances. But Americans
found themselves in the continent with few women, and
those in danger of savage ruthlessness. Hence they
became doubly concerned for their welfare, even to the
point of sentimentalism.</p>

<p>So, too, with regard to personal liberty. The pioneer
knew what his freedom meant to him, and fought for it
as a lion or a tiger fights for his. Too frequently his
own freedom could be bought only at the expense of
others around him. The word itself became a magic
with esoteric properties. Hence we find throughout our
West a fanatical regard for the term "freedom" that
sometimes works itself into a frenzy of intolerance. So
fine are the achievements of our coast states, on so high
a level is the standard of life, that men cannot see the
exceptions. When such are pointed out to them there
arises in their unconscious a fear of those horrible days,
a something which terrified their childhood and which
must be downed as the ghost of a crime one imagines himself
to have committed. Hence, not to be "with" certain
people in the West in the shouting adulation of their
state or their city or their orchards is a worse sacrilege
than counteracting one prayer by another ritual. The
winning of the West was the aim of all the pioneers. For
years and years they were faced with the most obvious
threats to its consummation. Mountains, climate, savages,
European jealousies, lack of population,&mdash;everything
that spelled despair stood before them. But an uncomprehended
passion drove them on. Perhaps it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
the recrudescence of intolerance which marked the early
settlers in the East. Perhaps it was the lack of opportunity
resulting from overcrowding after the advertisement
of the desirability of life in America. It may have
been any one of a dozen possibilities that kept men and
women moving on and on and on,&mdash;nor always, by any
means, the yielding to ideals. But on it was and on it
continued till the Pacific was reached.</p>

<p>This, superficially, is the accepted story of the development
of our West. I have attempted neither criticism
nor laudation. It is an unavoidable approach to the
discussion of America's place in the Pacific, an approach
which even the most Western of our Westerners is not
always prone to take cognizance of. But within it lies
the kernel of future American life. To some, like the
founders of the State of Oregon, it was more defined.
Some as early as 1844 realized that to the nation which
developed the coast lands belonged the spoils of the
Pacific and in its hands would lie the destinies of the
largest ocean on the globe. The opening of the Panama
Canal has placed the Pacific at the door-step of New
York, and fulfilled the dream.</p>

<p>But to the vast majority of people on the coast to-day,
occupation and development of those enormous areas
seem to carry with them opportunity, but little responsibility.
They have one concern which is akin to fear,
and that is of the Japanese. They only vaguely grasp
the significance of their fate. They do not see that they
have hauled in a whale along with their catch and that
unless they are skilful they will drag the whole nation
into the sea with them.</p>

<p>But if they have forgotten the vision for the appearance
of the catch, what about the East? The East is as
indifferent to matters pertaining to the Pacific and the
West. Its face is turned toward Europe. We think that
America is a nation, but the utter ignorance of one section
with regard to another, the lounging in local ease,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
is appalling. Easterners are like the philosopher who
when told that his house was on fire, said it was none of
his business, for hadn't he a wife to look after such
things! These are strange phenomena in a democracy.
People think that they discharge their duty by voting, but
how many people are in the least concerned with the
problems that will some day light up the country like a
prairie fire? Westerners are generally much more acquainted
with Eastern affairs. As unpleasant as is the
promotion publicity of Los Angeles, it is a much more
healthful condition than the seeming ignorance of New
York in matters pertaining to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Yet while the East is aflame over affairs in Europe&mdash;the
Irish Republic, for instance&mdash;it probably thinks that
Korea is the name of a Chinese joss over which no civilized
man should bother to yap about. This indifference
is not to be found in the man on the street alone. That
man is often uninformed simply because the dispensers
of information are uninformed. There is much he would
want if he knew its value to him. And so while we are
becoming embroiled in European affairs another and
henceforward more sinister problem is threatening to
back-wash over us.</p>

<p>It was while in such an apathetic state that America
changed her status from a continental republic to a
colonial empire. Few Americans have ever taken any
interest in their insular possessions. Hawaii and the rest
had fallen to the lot of the Government, and would sooner
or later be returned; that was the sum and substance
of their outlook on the whole affair. That the Monroe
Doctrine ceased to be a real factor with the acquisition of
these outlying possessions, that we virtually abrogated
it, did not seem to matter much. At large, the notion
was that American altruism would never involve the
country in any difficulty.</p>

<p>But whatever a man's motives, once he has stuck his
tongue against a frozen pipe only a tremendous outpour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>ing
of altruism will ever detach it. America began her
adventures in the Pacific when she urged young men to
go West. Now we have the whole continent, we have
Hawaii, the Philippines, Pago Pago, Samoa, and
Alaska,&mdash;a hefty armful. Are we going to let these
things go, or are we simply going to drift to where they
drag us into conflict with others who want them and want
them badly? We cannot merely blow them full of
democracy and then wait for any one who wishes to to
prick the bubbles. For it must be borne in mind that
the issues are clear. The Pacific cannot remain half-citizen
and half-subject. Every time we stir up within
a small island the self-respect of individuals, we destroy
the balance of power between an expression of the wills
of people and the wills of autocracies. Is America going
to set out to make the world safe for democracy in
Europe and then withdraw just when Europe needs her
help most? Is she going to continue to make treaties
with small nations like Korea and then when Korea is
devoured body and soul simply overlook the little fellow
as though he had never existed.</p>

<p>Let me make the case of Korea clearer by a parallel.
We had a treaty with the Kingdom under which we had
assured her that in the event of any other power interfering
with her independence we would exert our good offices
toward an amicable solution. Then came the Russo-Japanese
war. Korea received a pledge from Japan that
her sovereignty would be protected if she permitted Japanese
troops to pass over her territory. Korea, at the
risk of being devoured by Russia for violating neutrality,
acceded to Japan's request. Five years after the Russo-Japanese
War, Korea was annexed by Japan, and we
said never a word in her favor. Nor have we ever denounced
our treaty with Korea.</p>

<p>But here is the parallel. Belgium refused to let Germany
cross her territory. Because of Germany's invasion
of Belgium, Great Britain entered the war. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
if Great Britain now decided to annex Belgium? What
if America did so?</p>

<p>Yet Colonel Roosevelt, who was so vociferous in his
denouncement of the Wilson Administration for its early
neutrality in the face of the rape of Belgium, himself
condoned the annexation of Korea by saying that inasmuch
as Korea was unable to defend herself it was not
up to us to rush to her assistance. In other words, our
treaty was only a scrap of paper which was to be in force
if the other high contracting party was strong enough to
have no need for our aid.</p>

<p>Is America going to drag China into world wars
with promises of friendship, and then concede Shantungs
whenever diplomatic shrewdness shows her to be beaten?
Is she going to promise the Philippines independence, allow
her governor-generals to withhold their veto power
for years so that the natives may the better handle their
own affairs, and then simply let any who will come and
undermine or explode the thing entire?</p>

<p>This is not meant to imply by any manner of means
that America is to display force and employ it for the
sake of democracy. It is not navies nor armies that will
count, but principles. It is America's duty as a free
country to encourage freedom and discourage autocracy.
And in that spirit, and that alone, can she justify her
place in the sun. On several occasions she has done so,
though only those in which the Pacific are involved need
reference here.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>Apropos of the Philippines: Two factors and two alone
are involved. It is not a question of whether America
shall or shall not hold on to the islands. In that America
has given her word. The Philippines will become, must
become, free. There, as elsewhere, it is not our concern
whether one group or another gains the upper hand. It
is not our concern that the Filipinos, being Malay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>-Orientals,
will evolve a democracy that is not compatible
with our notions of democracy. Our concern is, and has
been repeatedly stated to be, only the welfare and happiness
of the Filipinos. McKinley, Taft, Roosevelt,
Wilson,&mdash;all have considerably discoursed upon Filipino
independence and Filipino welfare. We have recently
been on the very verge of granting independence, but, unfortunately,
oil has been discovered by the Standard Oil
Company, and the question will doubtless now depend on
the amount of oil there is. If a great deal, then fare thee
well Filipino independence! However, the real reason
for our being in the islands is neither the altruistic concern
for the democratization of the people, nor to protect
the immediate interests of sugar, tobacco, or oil-handling
capitalists. The one and only basis for our
action should be the extent to which Filipino independence
or our protectorate ministers to the peace of the
Pacific. If an independent Philippines will allay the suspicions
of Japan, then they should be independent. But
Japan would have to give more than the usual promise
of her word that she would keep her hands off the Philippines.
The extent to which her word may be relied upon
can easily be determined. One need only mention Korea,
Shantung, Siberia, the Marshall Islands. We say to
Japan: "As soon as you live up to the promises in your
treaty and other relations with these Orientals, we shall
be able to accept your further promises in regard to the
Philippines."</p>

<p>Yet it must not be overlooked that Japan saw our coming
to the Philippines with apprehension. Japan is an
Oriental nation and cannot understand any one doing
anything out of pure goodness of heart. Fact is, neither
can we. Let the most honest man in the world offer
any other a solid-gold watch and that other would suspect
something was wrong. We declared to the world
that we had only the best intentions toward the Philippines&mdash;to
democratize them. To Japan that was like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
holding up a red flag to a bull. What, you are going to
create a democratic sore right in my neighborhood? That
will never do. It might be catching. And Japan is not
interested in contracting democracy as yet,&mdash;that is, official
Japan. Even liberal Japanese are doubtful. When
in Japan, I interviewed the democratic M.P., Yukio
Ozaki. He turned, without question from me, to the subject
of the fortification of the Philippines. He pleaded
that the forts be dismantled. In the event of that plea
failing, what could Japan do, he asked, other than proceed
to fortify the Marshall Islands? Yet at that time
Japan had not even been granted a mandate over these
islands. The logic of his appeal is irrefutable. But this
is a sort of vicious circle. Who is to begin, and whom
shall we trust?</p>

<p>One thing is certain,&mdash;that in that whole problem of
the control of the islands of the Pacific, whether by
annexation, protection, or mandate, lies the seed of the
future peace of the Pacific. And unless in each and every
case the natives are given the best opportunities of self-development,
that nation responsible for their arrested
condition is going to be the nation upon whose conscience
will rest the sorrows of the world.</p>

<p>In regard to the Philippines, this must be remembered,&mdash;that
we are dealing with human beings, not problems
and principles. The stuff one generally reads
about foreign places might be just as descriptive of the
inhabitants of Mars. Little wonder that those for or
against independence or protection fail to win their case!
We must remember that for twenty years we have been
building up the hopes of children whom we taught in
our schools, with our money and our ideals. They are
now, many of them, active men attending to the work of
the Filipino world. They are our foster-children and
would be fools not to want to live their own lives in their
own way. Our policy in regard to them must be a negative
one; from now on it cannot be positive. All we can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
say to them is what we cannot and will not permit them
to do; we have no right henceforth to say what they must
do. We can say that we will not permit them to invite
any other nation whose governmental ideals are likely
to threaten ours. The world must continue on its road
toward the greater and greater liberation of peoples,
hence we cannot permit them to step back toward any
form of imperialism. We cannot permit them to invite
unlimited numbers of Orientals who might swamp them.
They must maintain the Philippines for the Filipinos,
with as much generosity thrown in as will not endanger
that. We must remember that our effort in the Philippines
is the first in which any government has attempted
to treat its subject natives with any degree of equality,&mdash;legally,
if not socially. If the world is to move on toward
greater freedom&mdash;which is needed, Heaven knows!&mdash;we
must not let the Philippines be an example of the failure
of democratic management of natives.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>In all this some may discover implications that our
hold on the Philippines should be maintained purely for
strategic reasons. That may be the purpose of the
imperialistically minded. There may be some who will
read into this fear of Japan or a bellicose attitude irritable
to her. Neither interpretation would be accurate,
for behind all this are certain historical factors which
prove that whatever use statesmen may make of world
situations, evil designs will be frustrated so long as the
circumstances which created the primary conditions were
not evil. Specifically, because the earlier relations
between Japan and America were brought about through
essentially good motives, these later developments can
be kept to a sane path. And severe as may be our present
criticisms of Japan, so long as the purposes behind
them are good, they can have only a desirable result.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>When Commodore Perry went to Japan in 1853, his
only desire was to open that country to trade. It may
seem now that for the sake of peace in the Pacific it
would have been better had he been guided by the spirit
of conquest. Had Japan been conquered in the early
days, she would never have come to the fore as a possible
menace. But she was not. It does not follow, however,
that that was unfortunate, for the earliest relations
between Japan and America were amicable and basically
altruistic. The relations between us have continued to
be amicable, but altruism has slowly given way to envy
and jealousy. But the point that is missed in all this
reference to these cordial relations of the past is that
inasmuch as America was a great moral influence upon
Japan in the early days, she might continue to be that
to-day. Cock-sure as Japanese statesmen have become,
and pugnacious as some Americans seem toward Japan,
a strong moral attitude will still do more to check hostility
than all the shaking of sabers and man&#339;uvering of
dreadnaughts. We need the Philippines more as a base
for democratic experiment than as a fortified zone. We
need them as one needs a medical laboratory for the manufacture
of serums in the time of plague,&mdash;for the manufacture
of the serum of political freedom, of the rights
of people to develop and to learn to be free. And this
experimental station should stand right there at the door
of Japan&mdash;and of British and French concessionists, if
you please, in China&mdash;and of China itself, for none of
them has any faith in this educating of natives and making
them your equals. Only down below the line, in
New Zealand and Australia, far from where it can really
affect Japan, is that experiment being carried on. And
more than all else, when Japanese imperialism is spreading
its wings, when Japanese bureaucracy is throwing
out its chest in pride and telling its poor, impoverished
people, "See what I am doing for YOU," we need that
serum station in the Philippines where a solution of de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>mocracy
and freedom may continue to be made,&mdash;be it
ever so weak.</p>

<p>And it needs to be injected into Japan. Some of it is
already working in that empire. Japan needs more, it
needs to be reinforced. Democracy in Japan is struggling
for a foothold. Let the germs of democracy persist
in the Philippines and be rushed to the island empire.
And let America stand as a great moral force, impressing
upon Japan that the rights of the people shall not
be suppressed. But that will never be unless the people
in America who stand for liberalism, for true democracy,
for all that America has hitherto meant wake up to the
seriousness of the situation in the Far East and cease to
turn from it with sentimental notions about Lafcadio
Hearn's Japan. There are two Japans.</p>

<p>Both of these Japans are watching America closely.
They are watching the actions of America in the Philippines,
they are following in the footsteps of America in
China. That need not be taken too literally, for there
are two meanings to it. One example points in one direction,
another in another. But one or two by way of
illustration will do.</p>

<p>When America returned the Boxer Indemnity Funds
to China for educational purposes a new precedent was
established in international affairs. No other nation had
the moral courage to follow suit. But just at the close
of the war, Japan, having replenished her exchequer considerably,
unloosened her purse-strings and returned the
balance of the indemnity funds to China. It was a case
of thrifty self-denial, a tardy giving back of gold that
none of the powers were really entitled to. As misguided
and foolish as the Boxer Uprising was, still had it been
a little better organized, none of the evils from which
China is suffering to-day would obtain. China should
have been as wise in her method as she was in impulse.
However, it is good to see Japan doing so much. She
should be encouraged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, seeing that American missionaries&mdash;and others&mdash;are
influencing China in the direction of Occidental culture,
Japan is following suit. Here it is likewise a tardy
giving back to China what Japan took from her centuries
ago, for Japanese Buddhism is only the sifting of the
Buddhism that made its way from India by way of China
and Korea. Still, it is worth noting that intellectual and
moral precedents are often as forceful as more materialistic
weapons.</p>

<p>Observing the influence that doctors and hospitals
wield in China,&mdash;the Rockefeller Foundation, for
instance,&mdash;the Japanese are following suit and establishing
hospitals in the interior. Educational and industrial
work likewise will lead the way for educational and industrial
work by Japanese in China. Witnessing the force
of friendship in America's relations with China, the
public in Japan is protesting against the antagonizing of
this gigantic neighbor to whom the Japanese bureaucratic
wolf has been making such grandmotherly pretentions.
And indeed there is much good reason for the
protest, for the Japanese merchant who expected so
much juice in that Chinese plum found that because of
antagonism, because of the rape of Shantung, the plum
momentarily became a lemon, to use a vulgar expression.
Japan, after the "peace" Conference contemptuously
handed over what didn't belong to it but a duped assistant
in the prosecution of the war against Germany
learned that there are more ways than one of killing a
cat. And China proceeded to gnaw at the vitals of the
Japanese bureaucratic wolf in a most telling fashion.
China declared a boycott of Japanese goods that was so
effective that it brought about a financial slump in Japan
from which she is not yet fully recovered. China was
of course forced to yield. One cannot live on sentiment,
and when Japanese goods are the nearest and cheapest
at hand, what could China do?</p>

<p>If only Japan could see the real significance of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
she would at once withdraw all her nefarious demands
on China, proceed sincerely and honestly to win the
friendship of China, and then undermine the very ground
of every foreign trader because of her propinquity. But
bureaucrats are blind. They are moles that move underground.
The ground of China is all broken up on that
account. One of these days the Chinese giant will clumsily
step, not in the wake of the mole, but on the mole
itself. Inadvertently, of course; giants are such clumsy
things!</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>These, then, are some of the ways in which Japan has
and has not followed in the footsteps of America.</p>

<p>Let us follow the Chinese giant a bit, and see what blundering
paths he has pursued. Unfortunately, he has had
his mind too much on the American colossus to observe
the mole. And so he blundered into accepting a republican
form of government. A vain <i>Malvolio</i>, he thought
he was being honored with blue and yellow ribbons on
his enormous legs, but to stretch the metaphor a little
farther, it turns out that these alien Lilliputians are
strapping him securely down to earth. The ribbons and
the Lilliputian bands are the foreign-built and foreign-controlled
and operated railroads which have been talked
of with sanctimonious metaphors to make them palatable.
And now China parades herself before the world as a
republic. That is some of the influence of America. The
Republic of China is our own handiwork. Is it anything
to be proud of? Poor China is a battered republic, with
hands outstretched, appealing to us for help. As I write
the newspapers tell of the appeal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
recently elected President of the South China Republic.
After surveying what he regards as the situation, exposing
the Peking government, declaring that but for its
intriguing with Japan there would have been unity
between North and South, and that the Northern mili<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>tarists
were profiteering in food during the recent
famine, and charging them with a string of other crimes,
he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Such is the state of affairs in China that unless America, her traditional
friend and supporter, comes forward to lend a helping hand in
this critical period, we would be compelled against our will to submit
to the twenty-one demands of Japan. I make this special appeal,
therefore, through Your Excellency, to the Government of the United
States to save China once more, for it is through America's genuine
friendship, as exemplified by the John Hay doctrine, that China owes
her existence as a nation.</p></div>

<p>Now let us listen to the word from Japan on American
diplomacy in China. The "Asahi Shimbun" said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of all the foreign representatives in Peking the American was the
least known previous to the revolution. A lawyer by profession, he
was not credited with any diplomatic ability or resource. Yet he will
reap more credit than any of the others on account of the ability and
energy which he has displayed. But what have our Government and
our diplomacy done to counteract the American influence? Our interests
in China far exceed those of any other country, and yet our officials
have allowed themselves to be outplayed by a diplomatically untrained
lawyer. China, which ought to look to Japan for help and guidance,
does not do so, but looks to America. The inertia of the Kasumigaseki
has given Mr. Calhoun an opportunity to restore American prestige in
the neighbouring country.</p></div>

<p>Japan has done nothing to gain the good-will of China,
and America is constantly veering her ship with its treasury
of Chinese good-will more and more in the direction
of Japan. We had in Japan a man of unusual gifts and
sagacity. Mr. Roland S. Morris, American Ambassador
under the Wilson administration, though avowedly a
friend of Japan, certainly had a most unenviable position
to maintain. He seemed peculiarly fitted for his post,
for during his years in Japan, notwithstanding the innumerable
missions that moved like settings on a circular
stage, and the infinite number of dinners that fall to the
lot of distinguished foreigners in Japan, he never seems
to have got political indigestion. And doubtless he is
to-day a friend of China.</p>

<p>With an eye to the "special interests" of Japan, Dr.
Paul S. Reinsch was permitted to throw up his hands in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
despair. We were not doing much to save China from
being Shantung-ed. Because Mr. Crane once undiplomatically
expressed himself in ways unwelcome to Japan,
he was recalled before he got beyond Chicago. Several
years later, Mr. Crane succeeded in smuggling himself
through to China as American Minister, and as far as
may be seen, he did noble work in connection with the
Famine Relief last winter. Now we have dispatched a
Japanophile to China. Dr. Jacob Gould Shurman was
so strongly impressed with the schools of Japan that he
gave up Cornell University to go to China and help
Japanize the Celestial. At least, that is the mood in
which he left America. A man who knows him well and
is close to the inner circle of American financial affairs
in China assured me the other day that Shurman would
not be in China six months before he would completely
reverse his sentiments, and regard Japan's work in
China as it is regarded by every one there who is not a
Japanese official.</p>

<p>Poor deluded, short-sighted Japan! She could have
China as a plaything if she only went about it properly.
Propinquity could put special interests in last year's
list of bad debts if Japan sincerely, honestly, firmly made
a friend of China, threw the doors wide open,&mdash;and then
laughed a hearty, healthy laugh at the efforts of white
men to outwit her in Asia. Propinquity has made Japan
Oriental, it has given Japan a script that opens the doors
for her more than for any other alien: Oriental methods,
Oriental concepts, Oriental customs and requirements
give Japan a better chance in China than all her millions
of soldiers and dreadnaughts ever will. Yet the little
mole loves it underground.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>Thus we are blindly following the Japanese mole. We
are catering to Japanese "sensitiveness" by sending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
diplomats with a list in the direction of Japan now.
Presently, I presume, we shall withdraw our diplomats
from China as we did from Korea, and forget about it.
But, then, of course, we sha'n't. Things in the Far East
are not going to pan out so easily, not in the matter of
China and Japan. Ever since the first American clipper
flirted with Chinese trade, American interests have
been involved in the interests of China, and they will
continue to be so involved. Without ordinary, decent,
honest trade among nations, the relationship of peoples
ceases to have its reason for existence. Just imagine a
world of nothing but tourists! But decent trade is not
the forcing of opium on a country against its will, as
Britain forced it on China in the early days and as
Japan forces it to-day. Decent trade is not the impoverishing
of native industries by the introduction of cheap
products from Japanese, European, and American factories.
Neither is decent trade altruism. The spirit of
really decent trade may be found, though not yet fully
defined, in the motives behind the consortium; but, then,
that scheme has not yet been proved workable. Its future
remains to be seen, and I shall later describe it as far as it
has gone.</p>

<p>It has been admitted, even by the most prejudiced&mdash;and
by Japanese&mdash;that America's practices in the Far
East, and China in particular, have been essentially well-principled.
The Philippines are restively seeking independence,
but they cannot claim that America's
protectorate has been discreditable. One could go on all
the way through to the return of the Boxer Indemnity,
and the only serious charge that can be made with truth
is that altruism has often been accompanied by indecision
and inefficiency.</p>

<p>The question that now faces the world is whether the
effect of Western democratic governmental methods,
which seem to have made a sudden, yet vital, impression
on the minds of the Chinese, shall become effective with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
time, or shall be uprooted by another Oriental country
for whom we have expressed constantly the most affectionate
regard. We do not love a child less because it
needs correction; correction, we realize, is the necessary
accompaniment of growth. Japan needs to be shown
the error of her ways; not in high-flown moral terms, but
in just plain, everyday examples of the impracticability
of her doings in China. Thus, having been instrumental
in the opening of Japan to the world; having acquired
possessions in the Pacific which must remain the outposts
of democratic management of native peoples; having set
an example of disinterested, generous treatment of
unwieldy China; having stood by as her friend, as her
preceptor, her sponsor; having, in a word, made that
inexplicable journey from the Atlantic to the farthest
reaches of the Pacific, let the robin say of Johnny Appleseed:</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>WHERE THE PROBLEM DOVETAILS</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>I have come now to the most delicate and most difficult
task in the whole problem, that of the dovetailing
of nations. Twice has this phase of the subject
come before us: once when we met it in that welter of
racial experiments, Hawaii and the South Seas in general;
and again in that great outpost of the white race,
Australasia. But in the one it is too localized, and the
other too much in anticipation. In Hawaii it is hard to
say which race has justly a prior right to possession; in
Australia the problem is only imminent.</p>

<p>But in California and the entire West the impact of
the two races of the Pacific has taken place. Nothing
but a just solution can possibly be any solution at all.
Let me therefore define the problem at the very outset,
lest that which is really irrelevant be expected, or insinuate
itself into the discussion.</p>

<p>Primarily, the problem of Japan in America is not
a racial one. Primarily it is political, and hinges upon
the rights of nations. Secondarily, it is economic, and
only in so far as the political and economic factors are
unsolvable can the problem become a racial one, and terminate
in conflict. All attempts at handling the situation
which do not take into consideration these two factors
would be like crossing the stream to get a bucket of water.
For nothing can be done without reciprocity, and reciprocity
is the last thing that Japan would ever consent to,
as it involves a transformation in her political philosophy
and the relinquishment of her own position from the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
outset. Hence, before we can even approach the consideration
of facts in California, we must get clearly
in mind exactly what Japan is doing within her own
territories. Japan is the appellant. Japan demands
that her people be given free entry the world over. We
are not asking her to let our people enter Japan and
her possessions as laborers and agriculturists. Hence,
before she can make her plea at all rational, she must
show that she herself is not discriminating in the identical
manner as the one she objects to.</p>

<p>Now, in only one or two instances have I seen that
question emphasized. In all the literature I have read
emanating from Japanese sources, in the lectures of its
propagandists here, I have never seen it faced fairly
and squarely. The actions of Japan are ignored or
glossed over. The protagonists of Japan in California&mdash;Americans,
mind you&mdash;make of it purely an American
issue, as though discrimination were a fault peculiar
to ourselves. Two blacks don't make a white, but
neither do two blacks quarrel with each other for being
black.</p>

<p>The questions in the order of their importance
then are:</p>

<p>Does Japan permit the free entrance of alien labor?</p>

<p>Does Japan permit the ready purchase by aliens of
agricultural land?</p>

<p>Does Japan make the naturalization of aliens easy?</p>

<p>Does Japan permit the denaturalization of its people
abroad?</p>

<p>Now, these are all political problems, for the simple
reason that the very economic conditions of Japan make
them unnecessary. That is, Japanese labor is essentially
cheap labor, and owing to the great crowding there
would be little likelihood of any great influx of Korean
or Chinese labor were the bars not raised fairly high.
And the bars are high. The number of Koreans admitted
is greater largely because Koreans are now subjects of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
the mikado, but even they are kept in check by Japanese
objections to their entrance, and conflicts between Japanese
and Koreans are not unknown. Chinese are permitted
to enter Japan only by special permission from
the local authorities, as provided for in a regulation in
force since 1899. Forgetting the two hundred and fifty
years during which the doors of Japan were sealed;
forgetting that even after the opening of Japan a foreigner
had to obtain a special passport to travel from
Kobe to Kyoto, a distance of forty miles inland; forgetting
all the psychological factors that have by no
means broken down the crust that still closes most of
Japan to alien possession or acquisition, one is still
amazed at this discrimination against fellow-subjects and
Chinese, to whom the Japanese are in some essential
way, at least, related.</p>

<p>But let us see what happens to these people when
they do get in. Let me quote a statement in the bulletin
of the East and West News Bureau, a Japanese propaganda
agency located in New York.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In Japan proper the Korean laborers are estimated to number about
20,000. Compared with Japanese laborers they are perhaps superior
in point of physical strength, but in practical efficiency they are no
rivals of the latter. They feel that they are handicapped by strange
environments and different customs, which partly account for their
low efficiency. But experienced employers assert that the Koreans are
markedly lazy, and that their work requires overseers, which naturally
results of curtailment of their wages.</p>

<p>According to inquiries by the Osaka police on conditions among
Korean laborers in the city, many of them have been thrown out of
employment on account of the economic depression; that they are
mostly engaged in rough work, such as carrying goods around or digging
holes, etc., as unskilled laborers. It states that they are indolent
and have no interest in work which requires skill and attention; they
are simply contented as cheap laborers.</p></div>

<p>This quotation is illuminating in many ways. First,
it strikes me as being anything but fair play on the part
of Japanese in America to send out such discriminating
and unkind accounts of a people whom they have
now taken in as fellows in an empire, and whom they
are "trying to assimilate." Secondly, it is not quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
true, for Japanese manufacturers are going to Korea
with their factories. If Korean laborers are efficient
in Korea, why not in Japan? But the fact of the matter
is that the Japanese, quite naturally, are not going to
give the best jobs to Koreans with their own men round
about.</p>

<p>Now let us see what the British Vice-Consul at Osaka
has to say of Japanese labor, in a report to Parliament.
Admitting that external conditions have much to do
with the poor quality of the Japanese workman, and that
in time and under better conditions he will improve, the
vice-consul says: "The standard [of intelligence] shown
by the average workman is admittedly low," while some
of his sub-captions are: "Docility," "Apathy," "Cheerfulness,"
"Lack of Concentration," "Scarcity of Skilled
Labor," and under the caption "Why Wages are Low"
he says: "Labor is plentiful and inefficient."</p>

<p>It is seen, therefore, that the opinion of the vice-consul
in the matter of the Japanese is similar to that of the
Japanese in regard to the Korean; and so it goes. The
point in the whole question, to my mind is, that Japanese
discriminate as much against other races as they are
discriminated against. Not until Japan lays low the
chauvinistic notions about the superiority of the most
inferior Japanese to the best foreigner can we expect
that other nations will set to work to remove the obstacles
toward a clear understanding.</p>

<p>In America the very reverse is true. No one ever
asserts that the Japanese is inferior to a white man.
What is said is that the white man is essentially an
individualist who at maturity starts off in life by himself,
whereas the Japanese is bound by all sorts of notions
of ancestor-worship which submerge him completely in
the group. Furthermore, as a group the Japanese are
able to overcome the greatest odds that any individual
can raise against them. The nature of that group-con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>sciousness
will be analyzed in the answer to some of the
other questions.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>But to return to Japan: That Japan has no occasion
for fear of a serious invasion of aliens is evident from
recent figures that show that there are only 19,500 foreigners
there, of whom 12,139 are Chinese, 2,404 Britons,
1,837 Americans, 687 Russians, 641 Germans, and 445
French. These figures are, however, unreliable, and
antedate the Russian Revolution. However, the question
here pertinent is whether any of these would be
permitted to engage in such industries as the Japanese
engage in here; for instance, agriculture. That can be
answered in the negative. The Japanese land law, however
generous it may seem from mere reading of the
statutes, does not extend that privilege to foreigners.
The first proviso of the law is that the person desiring
to own land in Japan shall be from a country wherein
Japanese are permitted to own land. In other words,
if America does not allow a Japanese to acquire land,
no American can do so in Japan. As it stands, therefore,
no Japanese can complain if American laws make
a similar ruling. The second provision excludes from
any and all ownership, in any and all circumstances, the
Hokkaido, Formosa, Karafuto (Sakhalin), or districts
necessary for national defense. Considering that every
other inch of ground is held in plots of two and a half
acres per farmer, to whom they are the beginning and
end of subsistence, the privileges innocently extended
are mighty short. The law virtually excludes all right
to any agricultural lands that any foreigner might be able
to avail himself of.</p>

<p>There is one kind of real property foreigners do wish
to own, and that is property for business purposes. But
they cannot own that, even; they may only lease it on
long leases under conditions that are frequently a hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>ship
and often enough insecure. They may lease land
under the so-called superficies lease, but that means virtually
evading the law, and is always expensive. Even
ordinary leases are frequently encroached upon, as foreigners
in the ports are only too well aware. While I
was in Kobe, Japanese were forcing foreign business
firms out of the former foreign settlement, which fully
fifty years of white men's toil had converted from a
worthless bit of beach land into one of the most up-to-date
"suburbs" in the Orient, and which is now the best
part of Kobe. This was done by calling in leases, by
making the rents prohibitive, and by "buying out" foreign
lease-holders at almost exorbitant rates, just as the
Japanese buy out white men in California. One British
druggist, Dr. Richardson, sold for $225,000 a corner plot
for which he had paid $12,500. He made a great profit
in the deal, but the process by which he, and others, were
bought out is indicative of the methods of the Japanese.
For behind many of the real-estate dealers was the Government,
making loans at most favorable rates of interest
with the sole object of getting back into Japanese control
as much of the port plots as possible,&mdash;cost what it
might. Even men of lifelong residence in Japan must
form themselves into corporations with their wives and
some Japanese as members, in order to own the land
upon which their residences are built. Some of these
cases I investigated for the "Japan Chronicle" and
learned from the priest of the Catholic Church that pressure
was constantly being exerted upon him to make him
relinquish his hold upon the ground on which the church
stands, because it is in the heart of the business section.
He said he did not know how long he would be able to
hold out against them.</p>

<p>How corrupt landlords may overstep the bounds is
illustrated by a case reported in the "Chronicle" of
February 10, 1921. The editor says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The notorious Clarke lease suit is a case in point. This was a lease
for twenty-five years, renewable for a further term of similar duration.
A syndicate of Japanese was organized which purchased the land,
knowing of the burdens upon it, with the hope of worrying the lease-holder
either into paying more rent or into selling the lease for an
inadequate sum. Suit after suit was brought in various names, until
at last a court was found to give judgment raising the rent on the
ground that taxes had increased and the value of surrounding properties
had expanded since the lease was made. In justification of a
judgment upholding this decision, the Osaka Appeal Court declared
that there was a local custom in Kobe which permitted a landlord to
raise the rent in certain circumstances. No evidence was produced
in support of this contention, which was clearly against all contract
law and rendered lease agreements meaningless. The result was that
the gang of speculators who had banded themselves together to despoil
a foreigner were successful. The holder of the lease was forced to
sell and the syndicate profited greatly.</p></div>

<p>If the argument is raised that you will find bad people
everywhere, and that one cannot take the poorest type
of person and set him up as the example, let us recall
the case of the Doshisha University. There, because of
these selfsame land and property laws, The American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions placed
the million dollars' worth of property in the hands of
Christian Japanese directors. Presently the Government
brought pressure to bear upon these directors, and
they yielded to their Government. In February, 1898,
they virtually ousted the foreign owners, turned the institution
into a secular college, and saw nothing dishonest
nor immoral in the action. Japanese have of course
come to a better understanding of the rights in such
cases, nor am I trying to impugn the integrity of the
"better-class" of Japanese. I am merely bringing evidence
to prove that not only are Japanese laws with
regard to the ownership of land by foreigners as discriminatory
as those of California, but their interpretation
is a serious handicap to aliens in Japan.</p>

<p>In America the fight is not to prevent Japanese from
taking hold of land for business purposes, but to prevent
them from monopolizing farming-lands, which, as Mr.
Walter Pitkin has shown so clearly in his book, "Must
We Fight Japan?" are rapidly passing out of American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
hands because of our vicious shallowness in agrarian
matters. I am not as yet bringing up the question of
fairness, justice, generosity, or the rights of over-crowded
Japan. I am merely making parallels which
seem to me telling.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>Does Japan make the naturalization of aliens easy?
As far as the letter of the law goes, there appears nothing
in the eyes of a layman that might stand in the way
of a man, already married and with children, from
becoming a Japanese subject. There is no legal discrimination
against any race or color. But notwithstanding
that there now are 20,000 foreigners in Japan,
and that the number throughout the years must have
been much greater, there are on record only nine cases
of foreigners having been naturalized between 1904 and
1913; two English, two American, five French; and ten
cases of adoptions by marriage into Japanese families.
These, to my knowledge, do not include men previously
married. They are all cases of men who have married
Japanese women, or of women who have married Japanese
men. There have been 158 Chinese who became
naturalized. This does not indicate that naturalization
is easy&mdash;except by marriage&mdash;and the general consensus
of opinion is that it would take a man fully fifteen years
to become naturalized in the due process of law.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the restrictions attached to the acquisition
of Japanese nationality take all the sweetness out
of the plum, for even after you have gone through the
regular processes and have been permitted to sit
"amongst these gods on sainted seats," there are still
exalted pedestals beyond your reach. You may not
become a Minister of State, President, or Vice-President,
or a member of the Privy Council; an official of <i>chokunin</i>
(imperial-appointment) rank in the Imperial Household
Department; an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
Plenipotentiary; a general officer in the army and navy;
president of the Supreme Court, of the Board of Audit,
or of the Court of Administrative Litigation; or member
of the Imperial Diet. Nor are the professions in all
cases open to you.</p>

<p>However, this is a minor matter compared with that
of the inability on the part of any Japanese to accept
another nationality without official consent. If he resides
abroad after his seventeenth birthday he cannot in any
circumstances become a citizen of that other country
unless he has completed his military service. Women
may freely relinquish their nationality through marriage;
not so men. If men are born abroad, they must
make a voluntary request for denaturalization between
the ages of fifteen and seventeen, but such other factors
are involved that only a negligible number of American-born
Japanese have ever attempted to rid themselves of
their ancestral connections; and there is one case on
record in which the Government refused on a technicality,
for the child had applied for denationalization according
to Western reckoning, whereas Japanese count
the child's age as from the day of conception, not birth.</p>

<p>In view of this, then, there seems no point whatever
in the fuss made about Japanese being barred from
citizenship. Again, I am not discussing the advisability
of this restriction, but merely trying to brush aside many
of the webs that have been spun for the netting of sympathy.
The relations between Japan and America are
thus involved in an infinite number of petty political
regulations on each side, and nothing but a complete
sweeping away of all restrictions on both sides would
ever assume even the semblance of justice. But how
far is Japan ready and willing to go in this denationalization
of herself? The most casual study of her
nationalistic aims and aspirations answers that question.</p>

<p>That the problem is essentially a problem for Japan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
to solve is self-evident. That it is political and not racial,
and that this political problem is rooted in Japan's
economic condition, is likewise clear. For no nation loses
its nationals except when the conditions at home are
worse than those abroad, worse than those of the country
to which her people wish to emigrate. Australia and
New Zealand find it almost impossible to lure out British
laborers, while Germany's desire for room was largely
for the utilization of her mechanics and scientists and
others whom she had trained in such large numbers that
she hadn't enough work for them at home. Two changes
in the structure of world economics have accentuated a
condition of racial conflict which have hitherto been virtually
non-existent. Religious and political conflicts
have always obtained, but the color line has been drawn
only in very recent times. As long as black and yellow
people have been of a lower order and have been willing
to serve the white, there was never any serious disorder
between them. The color line is not marked even
in Europe to-day, for the same reason that it is not
marked in Japan. Europe is herself too crowded to be
a desirable immigration station. Whatever the causes
of conflict may have been, to-day it is clear that they lie
in the endeavor on the part of white labor to maintain a
better standard of living than Oriental labor has yet
attained. And in exactly the degree to which certain
Oriental labor groups have risen above others, the conflict
becomes manifest,&mdash;to wit, the objection on the part
of Japanese labor to Korean and Chinese coolies. No
serious conflicts take place between Fijian laborers and
Indian coolies, because the Fijian maintains his standard
under competition, that being lower than the Indian's.</p>

<p>We have therefore to study the problem of Japanese
in America, the so-called race conflict, not so much as
it develops here but at its source, Japan. And there, if
I read Japanese conditions aright, the problem is political
and psychological in the main. Japan has come very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
far along material modernization; she has virtually
stepped up to the front rank of nations. But the most
casual observation reveals that that is only so in part,
that the advance is made as a government, not as a
people. That government is rooted in antiquated
notions, is vicious in many of its aspects, and is opposed
to even the most conservative developments of Western
countries. That government refuses to recognize the
social forces that are at work within Japan for the
leveling upward of classes. And there is the rub.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>Glancing over the history of the nineteenth century,
we realize that all nations have passed through a continuous
struggle of the masses for betterment of their
conditions, political and social as well as economic. During
the greater part of that century Japan lay dormant,
its masses mentally mesmerized. The sudden impact
of the West has stunned the people more than awakened
them. Only part of the social body is coming to life,&mdash;a
limb, an essential organ. To be generous, I might say the
brain is working, though from many of the actions of
Nippon that would seem doubtful. But certain it is that
whether it is the brain or merely the spinal column, instead
of limbering up the rest of the body as rapidly as
possible, it is trying to retard it. Hence, the feverish
condition of the country.</p>

<p>This is not mere speculation. As I have said, only
such countries as have an inferior economic condition
suffer from the exodus of their laboring people. That
exodus takes place for several reasons. From Europe
it has come because of the hunger for religious freedom,
to escape political oppression, or merely to get a new
start in life. And though we have few political or religious
exiles in America from the Land of the Rising Sun,
they come because of an unconscious desire for relief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
from Japanese social domination. I am convinced that
that which most Japanese so prefer in America is that
sense of individual freshness, that desire for individual
expression, for freedom from the clutch of family and
oligarchy. It is unconscious, and without doubt few
Japanese when brought face to face with the issues
would admit it, so deeply ingrained is the education and
training at the hands of the political administrators.
Only here and there is some such statement made, with
an eye to the press and the galleries.</p>

<p>Were Japan to extend to the masses greater freedom,
there would be plenty of work for them at home. There
is scientific advancement to be made. Japanese are
frightfully behind in the scientific habit. I have been
told by a friend at one of our greatest institutions of
medical experimentation that with but one exception the
Japanese who come there have to be constantly dismissed
for their incompetence. There was no anti-Japanese
sentiment in the mind of the person who made this statement.
Japanese still need generations of training to
acquire the scientific spirit. Their historians prove this.
In the business of life Japanese have plenty of work at
home which could easily absorb all the man-power, both
masculine and feminine, at their command, without the
necessity of shipping any of it abroad. But the vulgar
acquisition of wealth, the vulgar acquisition of political
prestige in the world, the vulgar appeal for equality which
no man or nation with true dignity and self-respect
would mouth to the extent that Japanese officialdom has
mouthed it, the vulgar wearing of its sensitiveness on
its sleeve,&mdash;it is these with which bureaucratic Japan is
preoccupied. While, at home, every effort on the part
of Japanese to secure manhood suffrage, to arise to the
dignity of true men, of which the masses are as capable
as any race on earth, is discouraged. On the one hand
pleading, in mendicant fashion, for racial equality
abroad; on the other, refusal to give the people at home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
racial equality. On one hand it is asserted loudly that
"The Japanese do not like to be regarded as inferior
to any other people. In no country will they be content
with discriminatory treatment";<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on the other, Prime
Minister Hara answers the demand for the franchise
with the maudlin fear that it would break down "distinction."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_6" id="Footnote_1_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_6"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> From the <i>Kokumin</i>, a leading newspaper.</p></div>

<p>So that the problem of Japan and the world is largely
a political problem which she must face at home. Raising
the standard of living; increasing the economic welfare
of the masses; extending the rights of the people
who are clamoring for it in sections, not only to the
intelligent elements but down to the very <i>eta</i>; cleansing
the social pores of the empire,&mdash;these will in themselves
automatically solve the problem for the world. The
people don't want conquest. They are not aggressive.
But the misguided leaders,&mdash;there's the rub.</p>


<h4>5</h4>

<p>As to Japan in America&mdash;or, more specifically, the
Japanese in California&mdash;the problem is for us to solve.
I once heard an American sentimentalist who practises
law, and hence assured an audience he ought to know
what he was talking about, say that the trouble in California
was that the Japanese will work and the American
is an idler and won't work. Why he wasn't howled
out of the auditorium I don't know. That America has
reared this vast continent and made it one of the most
productive countries in the world did not seem to enter
the head of this lawyer. Yet the Japanese problem will
not be solved by exclusion alone.</p>

<p>We hear constantly that the reason for the conflict is
that Japanese as groups and as tireless workers are
able to outwork Americans; and, in certain special types
of industry, that is proved. But were the conditions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>made more acceptable to Americans in those industries,
and were we to devise mechanical means of production
suited to them, it would not be long before Japanese
labor would find it extremely unprofitable to come here,
just as it finds it unprofitable to go to Manchuria and
Korea, where it has to compete with the cheaper Chinese
and Korean labor. Laws and restrictions can always be
evaded, and the price of vigilance is more costly than
the gain. But those laws that are basic in the condition
of life no man can evade.</p>

<p>The Gentlemen's Agreement has not worked because
gentlemen themselves seldom work. It has not worked
because it has denied America the right, as all nations
claim it, to determine who shall or shall not come in.
Gentlemen never exact such agreements from their
friends. They realize that a man's home is his domain,
to be entered only on invitation. Furthermore, the
agreement is not mutually retroactive. It says that
Japan has a right to decide the issue, and promises not
to permit coolie labor to enter America. I shall not enter
the statistical controversy as to whether flocks of Japanese
have or have not evaded the agreement. An agreement
such as that should be evaded, and was loose enough
to make evasion simple. That is enough of an argument.</p>

<p>Japan pleads for room on account of the tremendous
increase in her population every year. When a great
appeal is made, the number is stated as 700,000 or
800,000, according to the emotional condition of the
appellant. Professor Dewey contends that the Japanese
Government, in its own records, admits to only some
300,000 or 400,000 a year. Whether the increase in
California is or is not as stated, on one side or the other,
matters little. Japan's grounds for appealing for room
are sufficient. If the increase is so disgustingly large
in Japan, it stands to reason that it would be as large, if
not larger here, where economic opportunity makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
increase possible and desirable. Every child born in
America is a handle worth getting hold of. But on the
other hand, it is also true that wherever Japanese better
their standard of living their birth-rate falls, as with
every race. In which case there is only one answer to
Japan's appeal for more room: Better your standard of
living and you will not need to invade our house. That
disgusting process of breeding which aggressive nations
indulge in should be decried from the house-tops. It is
no great mark of civilization to breed like mosquitos.
Mosquitos need to reproduce by the millions because
their eggs are consumed by the millions by preying creatures.
Civilization makes it possible for those born to
survive. (See Appendix D.)</p>

<p>Some students of Far Eastern affairs, like J. O. P.
Bland, urge that Japan has a right to the occupation of
Siberia; and none will gainsay that. But the fact is
that though free to go both to Korea and Manchuria,
Japanese have not gone to these regions even to the extent
of one year's increase in population during the last
ten years. Where, then, is the argument? As has been
shown, they do not go as settlers because cheap continental
labor makes it unprofitable. They go as business-men,
as the advance-guard of the empire, as the rear-guard of
the army. No one has ever raised a voice against the
migration of Japanese to these unpopulated regions&mdash;with
the exception, perhaps, of the natives. But ever and
always one feels the hand of imperial Japan behind each
little man from the empire, and that hold on her nationals
is the thing that vigorous nations resent, because it
threatens to impair their status.</p>

<p>That is what California and the sixteen other states
who share her views feel. They are conscious of some
subsidy behind every extensive purchase of land. From
somewhere Japanese get enough money to buy anything
they want. It is always the paternalistic arm of the
Government round every little son of Nippon, or the em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>brace
of his family. That is where the problem begins
and that is where it ends. If only some chemical substance
could be discovered that, when poured over the
Oriental, would separate him from the mass, he would be
as good a fellow as can be found anywhere in the world.
But that was what always irritated me in my relations
with Japanese in Japan. I never met a man I liked but
that in order to enjoy association with him I had to tolerate
his group. If I started off anywhere with one, I
soon had a retinue. That racial clannishness is to be
found everywhere, but nowhere is it more sticky than in
ancestor-worshiping Japan.</p>

<p>Consequently, in whatever manner the problem is
finally solved here in America, one thing is agreed upon
by both Japanese and anti-Japanese,&mdash;that those here
will have to be redistributed over the country, their
clannishness broken up. That is a problem which affects
not only the Japanese. However, nothing that is now
done should in any way be retroactive so as to deprive
any single Japanese of the fruits of his labor. Whatever
solution is found for the Japanese problem in America,
one thing is certain,&mdash;that no war will ever be fought
because of Japanese immigration to America. Japan,
as has been shown, would have to readjust her own political
thinking to such an extent as virtually to revolutionize
conditions in Japan in order to make an issue of
the citizenship problem and the matter of alien landownership
here. Such a revolution would considerably reduce
the scope of the issues, they would fall apart and
virtually cease to exist.</p>

<p>If we are looking for the causes of a possible conflict
in the Pacific, they must be sought not in California but
in China. The dovetailing of the angle of our triangle
in America is contingent upon the dovetailing of the
angle of the triangle in Asia. The one in America can
be dislodged only by a wrenching apart of the angle
in Asia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>Japan's hegemony in Asia is a serious matter. Japan
is an industrial nation now. She is entitled to access
to unused resources in China. Propinquity accedes this,
but propinquity precludes the necessity of submerging
China in the process. The Open Door in China means
peace in the Pacific. We leave it to time to determine
what the walling up of that door would mean.</p>

<p>The tempest in the European teapot has become a
tornado in the Pacific. Small as the Balkans are,
they were the stumbling-block in the way of the downward
expansion of the European powers.</p>

<p>The tragedy in Europe has left Europe in the background.
Civilization is rapidly veering round in the
direction of the Pacific. There are little nations to-day
whose possession is as fraught with unhappy consequences
as anything in southern Europe ever was. Yet we
hear innocent dispensers of information assure us that
Yap is only a little speck in the Pacific over which no one
would think of going to war. They forget that America
nearly went to war with Germany in 1889 over the Samoan
Islands, which then meant much less to her. And
the settlement in Europe at the Peace Conference has
greatly enhanced the position of the present powers in
the Pacific.</p>

<p>Until very recently two developments in Pacific affairs
had not been given as much prominence in the press as
they deserved. One, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and
the other the British Imperial Conferences, held every
other year since 1907. Just in proportion as the Imperial
Conferences have become, as it were, a super-Parliament
to Great Britain, so has the Anglo-Japanese Alliance
waned. And just as the so-called mandates over the
various island groups in the mid-Pacific congeal from
lofty aspirations to concrete management there are
emerging in the Pacific the identical antagonisms that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
made of the little group of states in Southern Europe the
cause of the conflict.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Japanese Alliance was formed in 1902. Its
aim was to oust Russia, and to guarantee British interests
in China. Later on it was revised to include Japanese
protection over India. But consonant with that
agreement there blossomed in the British Empire a new
thing to be reckoned with,&mdash;an independent Australian
navy. That navy has by no means matured, it is not
and cannot for years to come be a great consideration
in the Pacific, but it has been from the start prophetic
and explanatory of much that is taking place to-day. It
is at the bottom of the problem, because it is the beginning
of Australian independence, of her rise to nationhood.
Let me rehearse the historical incidents in connection
with this development.</p>

<p>Now, until the advent of that navy all the colonies had
been paying certain sums yearly toward the maintenance
of the British Navy,&mdash;Canada, Australia, New Zealand
alike. But with the federation of the Commonwealth,
Australia began to agitate in no mistaken terms
for a navy of her own, to be built and manned by Australians,
and kept in Australian waters, rushing only in
an emergency to the support of the empire. Canada decided
otherwise,&mdash;i.e., to build her own ships, but to
merge them with the home fleet; New Zealand continued
the old scheme. Being twelve hundred miles away from
Australia, her isolation and her inadequate resources and
population made her more timorous. With Australia the
construction of a separate little fleet was the beginning
of a straining at the leash. Then came the Anglo-Japanese
Alliance, which, while it allayed the fears of the Australians
somewhat, intensified certain other phases of
the problem, such as the White-Australia policy. The
Russo-Japanese War did nothing to allay apprehension
on the part of the Australasians.</p>

<p>For years both the Dominion and the Commonwealth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
were absolutely obsessed by the naval question. Sir
Joseph Ward, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, championed
a single, undivided imperial navy; the late Mr.
Alfred Deakin of Australia stood out strongly in favor
of an independent navy. Seeing little hope of a very
strong concession from England, Deakin extended and
urged an invitation, in 1908, to the American fleet to
visit Australia. He admitted that his object was to
arouse Britain to fear an Australian-American "alliance."
The thrust went home. The English "felt that
it was using strong measures for an Australian statesman
to use a foreign fleet as a means of forwarding a
project which was not approved by the Admiralty." But
even Sir Joseph Ward let himself go to the extent of declaring
that they welcomed America as "natural allies in
the coming struggle against Japanese domination."</p>

<p>And when at last the American fleet came to Australia,
it received an ovation such as still rings in the conversation
of any Australian with an American. For an entire
week Sydney celebrated. Melbourne followed suit; New
Zealand could not but take up the cue. Every one pointed
with pride to the similarity between the Australian and
the American. Australian girls virtually threw themselves
into the arms of American sailors. It is even
said that many a sailor remained behind with an Australian
wife. Not even the Prince of Wales (now King
George) was given such an ovation.</p>

<p>After that visit, so cordial was the attitude of Australians
that everywhere they talked of floating the Stars
and Stripes in the event of&mdash;what? In the event of
pressure from Downing Street or from Tokyo. The
Australian temperament is not one which buries its grievances
or harbors ill-feeling. The Australian speaks right
out that which is on his mind. And though much must
be discounted because of this bubbling personality, almost
primitive in its extremes, nothing that affects Australia
can long be ignored by us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>Frankly, the situation is this: Australia is set on her
so-called White-Australia policy. Australia made it
clear to England that, alliance or no alliance, she would
never swerve from her policy of excluding Japanese and
Chinese. When the American fleet appeared, knowing
the exclusion of Orientals practised in America, Australia
felt that bond of fellowship which comes from common
danger. And everything was done to develop friendship;
America became the pattern for everything Australian.
Never particularly fond of the Englishman, at
times discriminating against him as much as against the
Oriental, advertising that "No Englishman Need Apply"
when looking for labor, afraid of the little yellow man
up there,&mdash;Australia naturally looked to America as a
possible defender.</p>

<p>But along came the European war. Great Britain
was in danger. America held aloof. Then everything
changed. The wave of anti-American sentiment in Australia
was much more pronounced than in New Zealand.
This was a strange anomaly, for inherently New Zealand
is much more imperialistic. But it was characteristic of
the Australian. There was almost a boycott against
American goods. One firm published a scurrilous advertisement
which the American Consul-General at Melbourne
showed me and said he had sent to Washington.
For a time it looked rather serious, but in view of the
Australian character, its importance was not very great.
It was the impetuosity of a little boy, disgruntled because
his opinion was not feared. Many said openly: "We
were so fond of America and thought you were our friend.
From now on we don't want anything from you. We
don't want your protection."</p>

<p>Yet, as late as December 8, 1916, the Sydney "Morning
Herald" said editorially: "And <i>those of us who think
of a possible run under America's wings</i> forget that her
strength at present is proportionately no greater than
our own [Australia's]. She is not ready for either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
offence or defence and she knows it. This being so, can
we ask Great Britain," etc. The feeling toward America
at that time was only commensurate with the petty jealousies
that now rankle somewhat because of fear that
America has taken to herself too much credit for the
accomplishment of victory. But then it gave that stimulus
to navalism in the South that the Australians
wanted; further, it gave birth to the movement for
greater independence in imperial affairs, which for
twenty-five years had determined the policies of the
several states.</p>

<p>Just recently a New Zealand navalist, writing in the
"Auckland Weekly News" (New Zealand), brought up
the dread specter "balance of power" again, calling
attention to the fact that inasmuch as Japan is a great
naval power and America is increasing her naval
strength, it is for democratic Australasia to see to it
that Great Britain does not lag behind with its fleet in
the Pacific,&mdash;to maintain the balance of power. And
the further sad fact was revealed that Australasia (seen
in the expression of this one individual at least) did not
care particularly whether, in the event of conflict, they
were on the side of America or Japan.</p>

<p>Feeling did not take the same turn in New Zealand.
That little country continued in its more imperialistic
tendencies, was content to be a finger in the great hand
of empire. In 1909, at the Imperial Conference, Mr.
Joseph Ward sprung a surprise by offering a battle-cruiser
to the Government without consulting his constituents
at home. For this he was knighted. But the
New Zealanders were in a mood to make him pay for it
himself when he returned. Mr. (now Sir Joseph) Ward
was severely criticized for what he did. He was ridiculed
even by the university lads during their "Capping
Carnival." They took him off in effigy and carried
a little boat with a sign saying: "This is the toy he bought
his crown with." Upon his return from the conference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
he lost his Prime Ministership and a "conservative" government
came into power. Later developments so justified
him that he became a sort of political idol for a
while. When the cruiser visited New Zealand, in 1913,
the excitement knew no bounds.</p>

<p>Germany was always regarded as a potential enemy.
The colonies had always arched their backs at the proximity
of German possessions in the South Seas. When
in 1889 Samoa was the bone of contention, the colonies
were rather eager to have America take it, in preference
to the Germans. Then, as Japan came to the fore, America
as a potential protection became more and more
obvious to Australasians. The Panama Canal intensified
their conviction. They looked forward to a combination
of British and American power for the furtherance
of peace as they conceived it should be maintained,
and consciousness of their own destiny in the Pacific
was stimulated. Suddenly they were brought close to
the United States. The anti-Japanese riots in California,
the annexation of Hawaii, the protectorate over the
Philippines all pointed to the Australasians lessons for
their own guidance. They could not expect from England
the same keen interest in racial questions which
manifested itself in America. America demonstrated
the dangers of having two unmixable races like the white
and the black together; Hawaii showed them that Asiatic
immigration is a breeder of trouble. They do not seem
to see that circumstances are not the same, that the pressure
of population has become much more keen, that
industrial conditions in the world to-day are altogether
different from what they were when Great Britain
refused to have her American colonies put down the
kidnapping of Africans; that America to-day has
110,000,000 people and has encouraged them to come from
every country in Europe, as Australia does not.</p>

<p>Australia looks only at the most obvious phase of
the problem,&mdash;that certain people are not happy together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Whether or not she over-estimates her own strength
against the pressure of changed conditions, remains to
be seen, but she is pursuing her own course with a certain
steadfastness that is at once a pathetic blindness
and a courageous self-assertion. In a country whose
political outlook is essentially generous, whose labor
experiments have been extremely costly to her, it strikes
one as a great contradiction of principle. How can a
labor government be so utterly opposed to the extension
of ideal opportunities to laborers from other lands seeking
to enjoy them? How can she be so utterly capitalistic
on a national scale when nearly everything within
her own ken is laboristic? The explanation of this
enigma lies in a certain measure in the manner in which
Australia has set about making herself independent of
her mother country and, while working indirectly for the
break-up of the empire, is becoming imperial in her own
small way. All these counter currents must be seen
clearly before understanding can follow. They whirl
about the pillar of imperialism&mdash;England&mdash;and have
come out clearly since the war. They hinge upon the
mandates over the South Sea Islands.</p>

<p>While, as has been shown, Australia has for twenty
years pursued a course that threatens to lead toward
separation from England, New Zealand has bound herself
closer and closer. Australia, however, has been
extremely shy of any semblance of rupture. She does
not want to break away. She feels her isolation too
much. But what she wants is in a sense the rights that
American states have within the Union. She wants to
be independent, to be able to develop in her own way,
to expand, if necessary, without danger of attack. This
spirit is inherent in the Australian temperament. When
I told any Australian that I was traveling and tramping
on "me own," he could not understand it. He could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
go without a mate. He wanted to be sure that if he got
into any scrape and was with his back to the wall, his
mate was there to help him. Still, he wanted to fight
alone. It did not seem to occur to any of these people
that a civilized man might go the wild world over and
not have occasion to fight. And this trait comes out in
Australian international relations. She wants to pursue
the White-Australia policy contrary to sentiment
in England, to develop her own navy, to hold the whole
continent against the time when full nationhood will
have become a reality. But for the time at least she
will not declare her independence of Great Britain. She
will not even give Britain the imperial preference in
trade which would compensate her for her trouble. But
she did show in the last war that she realized her responsibilities.
In the Boer War it was said that her assistance
was merely for the sake of giving her men adventure
and practice for possible later use in her own defense.
And in this war conscription was defeated because, as it
was openly declared, it was not certain what the turn of
affairs in Europe might be. It was felt imperative that
the men be not all gone and the continent left undefended.
And that contingency was voiced by the Premier of
Queensland as involving&mdash;Japan. To the outsider,
Australia's attitude seems extremely selfish, but to
enthusiastic young Australia, with the wide world before
her, with a future that looks as promising as that of
America, it seems the only logical one. And as long as
her potential enemies do not take the trouble to show
by deeds that they are not enemies, her reasoning is not
unjustifiable.</p>

<p>But a strange thing has happened to Australia. She
has got what she was after, and now she hardly wants it.
She fought for the imperial conference method of settling
imperial affairs. Australians have time and again
declared that though an empire, they are a nation first
and foremost. That the empire represented too hetero<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>geneous
a list of peoples for them to forget that an
Indian, though part of the empire, is still an inferior as
far as they are concerned. And Australia realized that
the mother country could not see eye to eye with her on
that score. Yet she insists on the Anglo-Japanese Alliance
remaining in some form acceptable to her and to
America. How is that to be? What has happened since
peace was declared?</p>

<p>Australia and New Zealand were loudest in the protest
against the return of the South Sea Islands to the Germans.
New Zealand soldiers had taken Samoa; the
Australian navy&mdash;what there was of it&mdash;had cleared the
neighboring seas of German raiders. But though they
asked that Germany be deprived of the possessions, and
though the leaders thundered for a New Zealand mandate
over Samoa and an Australian mandate over New
Guinea, the people realized that they did not particularly
care for the burden of looking after these lands. Mr.
Hughes of Australia urged annexation. The people as
a whole preferred that Great Britain should annex them
and guarantee the dominions against possible dangers
from enemy control. They felt they could not stand the
cost of governing them. They were even not averse to
their being turned over to America. They have come to
realize that they were much better off before the war,
when they merely contributed their small quota to the
support of the navy; now Great Britain has intimated
that she can no longer maintain that navy without their
full share in its costs. Besides, the mandate over the
islands is not going to be simple.</p>


<h4>3</h4>

<p>Before giving consideration to the developments which
not even the Australasians had anticipated, let us look
upon the gains they have made. They have acquired
some new possessions which make of them an empire
within the empire, as it were. The islands of the south
Pacific are to be ruled as though they were an integral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
part of New Zealand and Australia, yet they have their
own facets just as the Dominions had their own problems
within the empire. They afford them certain commercial
advantages: copra and cocoa from Samoa, phosphate
from Nauru, which alone has an estimated deposit
amounting to forty-two million tons. Nauru is of utmost
importance to them because they are extensive agricultural
countries. It has been agreed that Great Britain
take 42%, Australia 42%, and New Zealand 16% of the
export. The South Seas as a whole supply 14.7% of
the world's copra supply, and this may yet be greatly
increased. But this is nothing compared with the advantages
they afford as ports of call. Further, if the plan
of linking the islands together by wireless is effected,
they will become an outer frontier for the Antipodes
of inestimable value. There is even a faint suggestion
of binding them together into one separate governmental
entity,&mdash;a buffer state, as it were, between the big powers
in the Pacific.</p>

<p>But what are these few assets compared with the
greatly extended line of defense now left to the Dominion
to keep up? What is that to the great problem of
how to develop the native races? Australia is interested
in developing Queensland, a tropical region, not the distant
island beyond. The question of labor is bad enough
for themselves, without having added regions to worry
about. Throughout the Pacific the problem of where to
secure man-power is pressing. Hawaii cries for labor;
Samoa is in a similar state; Fiji is troubled with the indentured
Indians now there. Go where one will, the
islands would yield readily enough if cheap labor were
available. But Australia and New Zealand are not willing
to exploit these islands at the expense of cheap
Asiatic labor which evolves into a racial problem as soon
as its returns become adequate. As for the mandates
both labor and capital in the South Seas are not keen
about these war orphans. A further problem is, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
will happen when the policy applied to island possessions
conflicts with the course permitted by the law of
the mandate? What is worse yet, the mandate over
the South Seas has brought Japan closer by hundreds
of miles to both New Zealand and Australia, and has
thrown open the question of admission of Asiatic people
to these islands. The Australasians feel that
they are obliged to protect not only themselves from
Asiatic competition, but the native races as well. If
they are to carry out the provisions of the mandate to
rule the islands for the good of the natives, they feel
that they cannot introduce Asiatic labor, which undermines
the natives economically and morally every time
it is attempted. These are some of the problems Australasia
inherited from the Peace Conference.</p>

<p>How have they affected the relations of New Zealand
and the Commonwealth of Australia with Great Britain?
They have put a new strain upon the empire as such;
they have put an added strain upon the relations between
Japan and Great Britain; they have driven a
wedge into the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.</p>

<p>Further, the whole question of mandates as it pertains
to the Pacific has completely opened new sores.
The island of Yap, which has been in the press so much
of late, is an example. A blow at so vital a factor in
world relations as cables would be like a blow on the
medulla oblongata. Yet under that new and misleading
term, "mandate," Yap became Japanese, and the near
future is not likely to know just what was done when
Germany's colonies were apportioned under its ruling.
Yet what is fair for Great Britain and the Dominions
should be fair for Japan, and if mandate means possession
for one it ought to mean it for the other. But where
do we come in and where the peace of the Pacific? Already,
as stated elsewhere, Japan has had in mind the
fortification of the Marshall Islands. She is proceeding
to fortify the Bonin Islands and the Pescadores. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
is, according to a very recent rumor,&mdash;and rumors are
really the only things one can secure in such matters,&mdash;establishing
an airship station on the southeast coast of
Formosa,&mdash;not on the west, which would shorten her
distance to China, but on the east, cutting down mileage
to the Philippines. And we? Well, we know what we are
about, too. Hence, the sooner such matters as mandates
are defined, the better for the world.</p>


<h4>4</h4>

<p>How would these things work out with the new British
arrangement as to the control of the Dominions? We
have seen that behind the whole struggle for the development
of an Australian navy was the desire for greater
independence. As long as the war lasted, no troublesome
topics were broached. Now that the war is over,
one may expect the feathers to begin to fly. The Dominions
are not stifling their desire for greater and greater
freedom. They were involved in a colossal war without
ever having been consulted. They feel that now they
have earned their right to express judgment on international
affairs. They realize that nothing could be done
effectively if Downing Street were hampered by several
wills at work at the same time. Yet it is obvious that the
people of the Dominions are concerned first with their
own affairs, as nations, and are devoted to Britain only
in a secondary manner. They are now conscious of their
power, and are determined to wield it. They have made
and are doing everything to continue to make friends
on their own, by whom they mean to stand through thick
and thin. At the Peace Conference they were not inferior
to any of the deliberators, and signed the Peace
Treaty as virtual members of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>"But," asks the Wellington "Evening Post," "are
the Dominions ever to cast an international vote against
the Mother Country on a question relating, say, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
future of the Pacific regarding which their interests and
wishes might rather harmonize with those of the United
States?"</p>

<p>Mr. Massey, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, on
the other hand, held "that the Dominions had signed the
Treaty not as independent nations in the ordinary sense,
but as nations within the Empire or partners in the Empire."</p>

<p>But to show how complicated the whole position was,
a Mr. W. Downie Stewart, M.P., pointed out that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When New Zealand signed the Peace Treaty ... she took upon herself
the status of a power involving herself in all the rights and obligations
of one of the signatories.... That means that she may have
created for herself a new status altogether in the world of foreign
affairs, and instead of being an act to bring together more closely the
component parts of the Empire, it may be that it was the first and
most serious step toward obtaining our independence and treating
ourselves as a sovereign power.</p></div>

<p>And in connection with Samoa he says the time may come
when, having been recognized as an independent power,
they will be told "we look to you in future, whenever a
question of internal affairs arises, to act as an independent
power, making peace or war on your own initiative."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Hughes, of Australia, however, has
been steering a middle course. He points to the dangers
lying ahead, and to the absolute necessity of keeping
close to Britain. He urges that the alliance with Japan
be renewed, but in such a way as to leave no danger of
losing America's friendship. But he shows that the
spirit of independence is still uppermost in Australia.
Declaring that "The June Conference has not been called
to even consider Constitutional changes," he adds: "It
it is painfully evident from articles which have appeared
in the press and in magazines ... that to a certain type
of mind, the Constitution of the British Empire is far
from what it should be."</p>

<p>But though Hughes is to-day the leader of Australia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
it is not because he has the country back of him. It is
rather because there is unfortunately no better man on
hand. He has never cared much for consistency, and
even in the matter of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance there
is a suggestion of yielding that makes one feel uncertain.
He has declared that at the present conference the question
of a reorganization of the Government so as to
give the Dominions a direct share in the control of imperial
affairs is not even being thought of, but it is evident
in his speech that that question is going to be delayed
only because more pressing matters, such as the
Anglo-Japanese Alliance and Imperial Naval Defense,
must be dealt with first. In other words, as spokesman
he realizes that "little" Australia, with its five million
people and its vast continent has asked too much of its
parent to be allowed to stand alone. So he is pouring
oil on the troubled waters by trying to devise an Anglo-Japanese
Treaty "in such form, modified, if that should
be deemed proper, as will be acceptable to Britain, to
America, to Japan, and to ourselves."</p>

<p>But there is a third consideration in this whole question,
and that is Japan. What is Japan going to say
about it all? For some time Japanese have been rather
cool in their enthusiasm over the alliance, because it
seems to them to have outlived its usefulness and because
Article 4 absolves Great Britain from assisting Japan
in the event of war with America. The "Osaka Asahi,"
one of the most influential of Japanese journals, has
boldly advocated its abrogation. The reason for both
British and Japanese indifference is obvious. Russia and
Germany are out of the way. British mercantile interests
are not at all satisfied with Japanese methods in China.
The alliance has been disregarded twice,&mdash;when the Sino-Japanese
Military Agreement was signed, and when the
Twenty-one Demands were made. Furthermore, the alliance
never protected Japanese interests when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
came in conflict with the interests of the colonies, nor has
it prevented British interests from suffering in the Far
East. As a protective alliance it has little more to do
except to guarantee Great Britain against Japan and
Japan against Great Britain. China is extremely antagonistic,
because she deems herself to be the worst sufferer.
She is the main point under consideration, yet
she has not been consulted. Hence she has done everything
in her power to arouse public opinion against its
renewal.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Japan has been concerned enough for
the renewal of the alliance to make a departure from her
age-long attitude toward the imperial family that is
extremely interesting if not illuminating. The recent
visit to England of Prince Hirohito, heir to the throne,
while meant to widen his grasp of world affairs, was certainly
intended also to arouse public feeling there in
favor of Japan and the alliance. This was the first time
that any Japanese prince of the blood had left Japan.
He hobnobbed with the common people, a thing unheard
of in Japan. But if he succeeded in winning popular
approval for the alliance, it was doubtless worth while
from the Japanese point of view. Otherwise the
risk would not have been justified, for such visits are not
without their dangers. It is interesting to recall that
when Nicholas, Czarevitch of Russia, made a tour of
the world upon the completion of the Siberian Railway,
in 1891, he passed through Japan. An attack upon his
person by a Japanese policeman nearly brought down
the wrath of the czar upon Japan, and there was much
explanation.</p>

<p>While Japan was anxious to have the alliance renewed,
she argued that England was more in need of it than she.
America, she said, had somewhat eclipsed England.
Japanese feel that England must now lean on Japan as
never before. They felt this when the alliance was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
formed. Count Hayashi, in his "Secret Memoirs,"
quotes a statement attributed to Marquis Ito, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is difficult to understand why England has broken her record in
foreign politics and has decided to enter into an alliance with us; the
mere fact that England has adopted this attitude shows that she is
in dire need, and she therefore wants to use us in order to make us
bear some of her burdens.</p></div>

<p>Ito was then playing Russia against England. To-day
England is being played against America, and the colonies
are eager to utilize the feelings of Japan and America
for a greater Pacific fleet and for their own augmented
freedom within the empire. There is much talk
of a secret agreement existing between Japan and Great
Britain. Even if there were, Great Britain would be
able to live up to it, in the event of war between Japan
and America, only at the risk of losing her colonies.</p>

<p>However, that need not be taken as a serious check, for
though Great Britain wants her colonies, she does not
want them enough to forego all other considerations.
On the other hand, a good deal of the pro-American
feeling in the colonies cannot be accepted too easily, for,
as we have seen, when America remained neutral they
forgot blood relationship in their criticism. To-day
there are interpretations of the alliance which would put
Great Britain in exactly the same position toward her
younger "daughters" for which Australasia condemned
America in 1914-17. But both the psychological and material
elements in the situation point to an absolutely
united front in Australasia for America in event of all
the talk about war with Japan coming to a head. That is
best illustrated by a statement in the "Japan Chronicle."
The editor says: "As we have repeatedly pointed out,
it is unthinkable that Britain should join Japan in actual
warfare with America. No Ministry in England which
deliberately adopted such a policy would live for a single
day." And the colonies, from Canada to Australia, will
echo that sentiment, as they did boldly at the Conference.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>But it seems that with so much of the world vitally
interested in maintaining peace in the Pacific there
should be no difficulty at all in so doing. The colonies
are sincere in their desire for amity with America; nor
is it merely a matter of common language. No one who
has taken the trouble to inquire into Far Eastern affairs
finds the handicap of language even the remotest cause
of misunderstanding. Actions speak louder than words,
and none but the ignorant can now misread what is going
on in Asia. Let but those actions coincide with the
promises made, with the spirit of the alliance and with
the constant expression of amity and good-will, and we
shall see the mist of war in the Pacific clear as before
the glories of the morning sun.</p>

<p>There seems, therefore, no justification for the renewal
of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. It is to all intents
and purposes virtually dead. Alliances on the whole
have proved themselves treacherous safeguards. Is
there not something which can be substituted for them?
Cannot co&ouml;peration among nations replace intriguing
misalliances, with their vicious secret diplomacy? One
way has been launched, and in the succeeding chapter its
character will be analyzed.</p>

<small>THE CONSORTIUM FOR FINANCING CHINA</small></h3>


<h4>1</h4>

<p>If all goes well, the open shop in international finance
is a thing of the past; at least so far as China goes.
On May 11, 1920, exactly eighteen months after the signing
of the armistice, Japan formally declared her willingness
to enter the new consortium for lending money to
China, and on October 15, following, representatives of
the British, French, Japanese, and American banking-groups
met in New York and there signed the provisions
by which they are for the next five years going
to finance China under what is known as the Consortium
Agreement.</p>

<p>For a full year after the signing of the armistice,
Great Britain, France, and America had been ready to
act in consort in the matter of future loans to China, but
Japan insisted on excluding from the terms of the agreement
international activity in Manchuria and Eastern
Inner Mongolia. These two provinces have virtually become
Japanese territory. Into these she has extended
her railroads or added to those built by Russia, and over
these she watched as a hen over ducklings. And because
she strenuously sought to man&#339;uver the Allies
into admitting her prior rights to these regions, the consummation
of the Consortium Agreement was delayed
and delayed. Japan finally yielded, at the same time
claiming that the powers conceded her special interests;
while they, through their chief representative, Mr.
Thomas W. Lamont, claimed that Japan waived these
interests. We shall presently see what happened, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
in the meantime it is obvious that both yielded and both
won out,&mdash;and that no nation is to-day sufficiently powerful
and self-contained to be able to stand apart from
the rest of the world. The closed shop in international
finance has been ushered in, and the union of world
bankers is now known as the Consortium.</p>

<p>In a chapter it is hardly possible to make more than
a hasty survey of so intricate a stretch of history.
China before the war with Japan was free from debt, but
in order to meet the indemnity demanded by Japan she
was compelled to raise money abroad. The scramble
among the foreign powers to advance this money gave
China certain advantages. Her own capitalists had money
enough to pay off this indemnity immediately, but they
did not trust their government and hoarded their funds.
They knew that with the Oriental system of "squeeze"
only a fraction of it would succeed in freeing their
country.</p>

<p>Another factor conspired to introduce alien domination
over China,&mdash;her lack of railroads and modern industries.
She had wealth, man-power, everything that
an isolated nation could possibly desire, but she was no
longer an isolated nation, and she had nothing that an
active nation among nations needed for its very existence.
Instantly, along with the loans, came concessions
for railroad-building, and the development of China began.
So deeply was China getting embroiled in alien
machinations that five years later, seeing that the young
emperor himself, Huang-Hsu, was head-over-heels in love
with Western ways, the reactionaries precipitated the
Boxer Uprising in 1900. This only resulted in another
overwhelming indemnity, which China has not yet succeeded
in paying off. Consequently, more loans had to
be made, and more urgent still became the necessity for
means of transportation and for the modernization of
industry.</p>

<p>The Russo-Japanese War, which ordinarily might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
have meant a modicum of relief to China, only succeeded
in entrenching her enemy much more securely at her
very door, and another period of alien scrambling over
Chinese loans set in. Co&ouml;peration among various groups
of foreign bankers regardless of nationality was not unknown,
for absolute competition would most likely have
been fatal. But thoroughly thought-out getting together
was, in view of the existing jealousy among nations,
inconceivable. Still, to such a pass had this suicidal
competition come that by 1909 a consortium was proposed
which aimed to include Russia, Japan, Germany,
France, England, and America. It began to work, but
Secretary of State Knox made a proposal for the neutralization
and internationalization of the Manchurian
railway system which met with a cold no from Japan.
Shortly afterward Japan made an agreement with Russia
which completely frustrated Knox's proposals, and the
thing virtually fell through.</p>

<p>In 1913, President Wilson took the matter in hand.
He refused to become a party to a scheme which, in his
estimation, instead of working for the rehabilitation of
China and the Open Door bound her helplessly. And
ever since China has been getting "the crumby side" of
every deal. For the plan as it then existed had no provisions
against the pernicious practice of marrying China
to one power after another with concessions, without
giving any guaranty of the preservation of her dower
rights,&mdash;freedom in her industrial and political affairs.</p>

<p>Russia then was Japan's "natural" enemy. Russia
was threatening the "very existence" of Japan. Yet
when Knox's proposal came up, Japan was ready to
unite with Russia in order to keep the others out of
Manchuria. She had to use that argument to save her
face. Bear this in mind, for we shall presently see that
a second time Japan used this argument in order to keep
the consummation of the consortium in abeyance. It
was more than a plea for special interests because of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
propinquity; it was a plea that the peace and safety of
the empire demanded it.</p>

<p>Propinquity! The pin in that word has pricked nearly
every one who has shown any interest in China, no matter
where. Japan used propinquity as a justification of
her annexation of Korea, breaking her word to that kingdom
in so doing. Yet Japan contends that she never has
broken her word. Japan is a nation true to her word,
but, like many another nation, is loose in her wording.
She has guaranteed the Open Door in Manchuria and
Mongolia,&mdash;and Korea. In Korea the door is shut, and
Japan has made entrance to the other spheres of little
advantage. Ill-content with penetration of these regions,
she has, by means of her railroads there, sought to divert
the course of Chinese trade from Shanghai through
Manchuria and Korea and Japan. In this there is nothing
intrinsically wrong. But she goes farther and tries
to exclude consortium activity in other fields in these
two provinces. But that these are not the only slices
of China she is after,&mdash;that they are, in fact, only stepping-stones
for the final domination of the great republic,&mdash;is
attested to by certain well-known facts in Far Eastern
affairs.</p>

<p>Japan and her friends assert she never has broken
her word; her enemies declare she is sinister and not to
be trusted. Neither statement is correct. Her methods
may sometimes be sinister, but no one who follows events
in the Far East is unaware of them, and Japan has taken
no pains to conceal them. Actions speak louder than
words. But has Japan actually never broken her word?
We have already referred to Korea, whose independence
Japan has guaranteed by published treaty. During the
war Japan carried out the requirements of the Anglo-Japanese
Alliance, but Article V reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The High Contracting Parties agree that neither of them will, without
consulting the other, enter into separate arrangements with another
Power to the prejudice of the objects described in the Preamble of
this Agreement.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>
<p>Notwithstanding this clear stipulation, Japan immediately
after capturing Kiao-chau from Germany, without
consulting Great Britain as herein provided, issued
the Twenty-one Demands on China. Of these Group V
alone would have made a vassal state of China had she
accepted them. Knowledge of these were kept from
Britain completely, but when they finally leaked out,
Japan vociferously denied them. Downing Street was not
pleased, but there was much to be done in Europe just
then. In 1918, Japan a second time made an arrangement
with China without consulting her ally, Great Britain.
This time it was the Sino-Japanese Military Agreement.
At the moment Russia withdrew from the war
and released the German prisoners, and that was the
excuse for imposing combined military action under Japanese
officers.</p>

<p>As though this were not enough, when the success of
Germany on the western front was at its height, Count
Terauchi, Prime Minister and arch-plotter in China,
came out with a statement published by Mr. Gregory
Mason of the "Outlook" to the effect that it was not
unlikely that some understanding, if not alliance, might
be effected between Japan, Russia and Germany. And
the rumors of such an understanding having been actually
arrived at, have since been shown to have had just
foundation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since 1917, according to "Millard's Review"
for April, 1920, Japan has lent China about 281,543,762
yen or thereabouts, privately, for political and
industrial purposes, for reorganization, railway construction,
munitions, canal improvements, flood relief,
wireless, forestry, war participation, and other undertakings.</p>

<p>These things must be recalled in considering the new
consortium, as they show what led up to its final consummation.
These actions of Japan indicate encroachment
upon China to the extent of virtually closing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Open Door. In this regard, the alliance has had a dual
effect: while it makes possible for Japan to go as far
as Britain would dare go, and even farther, on the other
hand it tends to keep Japan in check. Hence, the state
of mind of the Japanese on the subject of the treaty
has been contradictory. They have regarded its renewal
and its abrogation with about equal anxiety. From a
moral point of view, they dare not stand alone in the
world, being the only great autocracy remaining. Conscious
of their power and twitching under the restraint
which the alliance imposes, yet needing its support, they
are trying to make it appear that Great Britain needs it
fully as much.</p>

<p>As far as Great Britain goes, the alliance was formed
chiefly to guarantee the interests of the empire, but also
the Open Door and China's integrity. That is, that
Japanese Yen and British Sovereigns should have full
freedom to go to China to earn a living. Let us see what
the various treaties and understandings purport to accomplish.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Japanese Alliance assures "The preservation
of the common interests of all Powers in China by
insuring the independence and integrity of the Chinese
Empire and the principle of equal opportunities for the
commerce and industry of all nations in China."</p>

<p>The Root-Takahira Understanding declares: "The
Policy of both Governments [Japanese and American],
uninfluenced by any aggressive tendencies, is directed
to the maintenance of the existing <i>status quo</i> in the region
above mentioned and to the defense of the principle
of equal opportunity for commerce and industry in
China." In other words, without an alliance, America
has secured from Japan an understanding guaranteeing
the integrity of China and the Open Door for her pet,
the Dollar. Hence, except for the fact that it made no
promises to the effect, "My Ally, right or wrong, but
still my ally," this agreement says that the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
Dollar has as much right to earn a living in China as
the Yen has.</p>

<p>But in the meantime the Yen has been having it all his
own way, for the Sovereign and the Franc and the Dollar
were very busy doing things in Europe. And in good
Oriental fashion the Yen has been breeding, and breeding
rapidly. He was going to China, as we have seen,
by the million and keeping China's interests and integrity,
which all had guaranteed, in a very feverish state,
notwithstanding alliances and agreements born and in
embryo.</p>

<p>This, at bottom, is what the whole Far Eastern problem
is,&mdash;all of the governments seeking opportunities
in China and mutually binding and barring one another
from aggression and concessions. They have all guaranteed
China's "integrity," but none, except America,
has actually lived up to the agreement, and China's integrity
is rapidly ceasing to be an integer.</p>

<p>Now, if that were all there was to it, debate would be
childish, but integers, like the atom, are not easily divided
without creating something new. The atom becomes
an electron; and the integer, when a nation,
becomes a source of international conflict. Hence, it is
of the utmost importance that China remain an integer.
The Anglo-Japanese Alliance has failed to maintain
China's integrity. The Root-Takahira Agreement seemed
to cover the ground well enough, but that it was not sufficient
is proved by the later necessity on the part of Mr.
Lansing to supplement it by his so-called "understanding"
with Viscount Ishii. However, that the Ishii-Lansing
Agreement is loose and inadequate was obvious on
the face of it and it was shown to be absurd when the
Consortium Agreement was being negotiated. It seems
that Secretary-of-State Lansing, realizing that his
"agreement" with Ishii was being translated into a Monroe
Doctrine of Asia, as it was never intended to be,
fostered the new Consortium Agreement in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
throw a ring round the Ishii-Lansing Agreement and define
its limitations. With the very first approach the promoters
of the consortium made to Japan, Japan, as we
have seen, began eliminating from its scope everything
that propinquity permitted, threatening not only the consortium
but the various previous agreements. I state
these facts not to condemn Japan, but to delve into the
psychology of the powers who, at the Peace Conference
at Versailles, came to the conclusion that the only solution
for the situation in the Far East was a co&ouml;perative
scheme. They must be borne in mind in order to understand
why Japan withheld from concurring, and finally
yielded.</p>


<h4>2</h4>

<p>America was viewing all this with no little apprehension.
Matters in the Far East were extremely precarious
at the time she entered the war. It was in order to reassure
Japan and merely as a restatement of issues that the
Ishii-Lansing Agreement was made. Japan's propinquity
was recognized. But it was also recognized that
the Open Door was being walled up. Hence, the American
Government, which had withdrawn from the Sextuple
Consortium, suggested that a new consortium
agreement be made in which the four leading powers
take equal part. These powers had been drawn closer
together during the war, and that concord was to be taken
advantage of before it had a chance to dissipate.</p>

<p>At the time that I wrote the article on "Lending
Money to China" for the "World's Work," August, 1920,
the whole consortium scheme was shrouded in mystery.
Since then the correspondence that took place between
the powers has in part been published. The way it developed
is worthy of being outlined.</p>

<p>The American bankers had been asked by the Government
to enter the proposed consortium. They were not
over-enthusiastic about it, for at the time they felt they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
had enough demand at home and in Europe for such
funds as they could command. They realized that at
that time (July, 1918) they would be expected to carry,
with Japan, both England and France, but they agreed
that "such carrying should not diminish the vitality of
the membership in the four-Power group." But they
did stipulate that "One of the conditions of membership
in such a four-Power group should be that there should
be a relinquishment by the members of the group either
to China or to the group of any options to make loans
which they now hold, and all loans to China by any of
them should be considered as a four-Power group business."</p>

<p>Lansing replied to the bankers, accepting their stipulations,
obviously his main intention in working for the
consortium being, as I have said, to encircle the problem
with a view to defining its limitations so as to make it
impossible for Japan to interpret his agreement with
Ishii too broadly.</p>

<p>These communications were transmitted to the British
Foreign Office, prompting a reply from Mr. Balfour
on August 14, 1918, wherein he inquired whether it was
the intention of the American Government to enter the
$100,000,000 loan to China for currency reform which
was then under consideration and toward which Japan
had already made two separate advancements; and
whether it was the intention of the United States to
confine activities to administrative loans or to include
industrial and railway enterprises as well. Lord Reading
made inquiry of the State Department and determined
that both types of loans had been considered.</p>

<p>It is obvious from these communications that both
Japan and Great Britain wished to retain their special
interests in regard to the existing railway and industrial
loans, and balked at their being pooled with those of the
consortium. But England was ready enough from the
beginning to forego these. The United States held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
"that industrial as well as administrative loans should
be included in the new arrangement, for the reason that,
in practice, the line of demarcation between those various
classes of loans often is not easy to draw."</p>

<p>Everything went along smoothly until Japan was consulted,
and then it was found that while she was willing
enough to enter into a consortium for the whole of China,
she was emphatically unwilling to have Manchuria and
Mongolia included. From the very beginning, the American,
British, and French banking-groups and governments
most decidedly refused to accede to Japan's
demands in this matter, declaring that such a rendering
would simply open up the sores of spheres-of-interests
and concession-hunting, and completely nullify the purposes
and intentions of the consortium. The Japanese
argument is amusing. When Japan first encroached upon
Manchuria and Mongolia, it was because of danger to her
safety from Czarist Russia. Now she was face to face
with Bolshevist Russia, and she trembled for her safety
in these terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Furthermore, the recent development of the Russian situation, exercising
as it does an unwholesome influence upon the Far East, is a
matter of grave concern to Japan; in fact, the conditions in Siberia,
which have been developing with such alarming precipitancy of late,
are by no means far from giving rise to a most serious situation, which
may at any time take a turn threatening the safety of Japan and the
peace of the Far East, and ultimately place the entire Eastern Asia
at the mercy of the dangerous activities of extremist forces. Having
regard to these signals of the imminent character of the situation, the
Japanese Government all the more keenly feel the need of adopting
measures calculated to avert any such danger in the interest of the
Far East as well as of Japan. Now, South Manchuria and Mongolia
are the gate by which this direful influence may effect its penetration
into Japan and the Far East to the instant menace of their security.
The Japanese Government are convinced that, having regard to the
vital interests which Japan, as distinct from the other Powers, has in
the regions of South Manchuria and Mongolia, the British Government
will appreciate the circumstances which compelled the Japanese Government
to make a special and legitimate reservation indispensable to
the existence of the state and its people....</p></div>

<p>The utter fallacy of this is obvious. The consortium was
not a miracle-worker. Its efforts would necessarily ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>tend
over a series of years; its principals were as opposed
to Bolshevism as Japan was. But there was Japan,&mdash;bureaucratic,
imperialistic Japan,&mdash;shedding tears
over the prospect of what might happen to her people
from Bolshevism if the consortium were permitted to
take a share in the development of Manchuria and Mongolia,&mdash;to
which she has no right other than that of her
might.</p>

<p>No pressure such as could be said to be in the nature of
an ultimatum to join the consortium was exerted, of
course, but it was obvious that unless Japan withdrew
her objections the consortium would not materialize.
Japan made an effort to get the other powers to make
some written statement or accept her formula securing
to her these special rights; but the others were adamant.
Japan specified just what she feared,&mdash;the construction
of other railroads.</p>

<p>The United States replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The American Government cannot but acknowledge, however, its
grave disappointment that the formula proffered by the Japanese Government
is in terms so exceedingly ambiguous and in character so
irrevocable that it might be held to indicate a continued desire on the
part of the Japanese Government to exclude the American, British,
and French banking groups from participation in the development,
for the benefit of China, of important parts of that republic, a construction
which could not be reconciled with the principle of the independence
and territorial integrity of China.</p></div>

<p>It is interesting to note that in all these communications,
the Japanese Government is constantly referring
to its own special interests and dangers, whereas the
others repeat and repeat their concern for the integrity
of China. It may be, after all, that the Japanese Government
is the more honest, though America's stand is
unchallengeable.</p>

<p>I have dwelt sufficiently, I believe, with the emanations
from behind departmental doors. The human elements
are much more interesting. Suffice it to say that
Japan held out for a long, long time, and things seemed
hopeless. At last, after an understanding with all those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
concerned outside Japan, Mr. Thomas W. Lamont went
to the Far East as spokesman for the other powers, to
carry on negotiations with Japan.</p>

<p>Unfortunately&mdash;whether by design or not I have no
way of telling&mdash;an American business mission also went
to Japan at that time, upon the invitation of Baron Shibusawa,
popularly known as the "Schwab of Japan."
Everybody got these two parties mixed, but I have since
been very earnestly assured that Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip,
who headed the business mission, had nothing whatever
to do with Mr. Lamont's mission. Be that as it may,
it was certain even from the twin-reports that while the
business mission was being lavishly entertained, Mr.
Lamont was seeing all that he wanted to see, and saying
all that he wanted to say. The mission was discussing
with Junnosuke Inouye, Governor of the Bank of Japan,
and Baron Shibusawa, and others such questions as Japanese
immigration, the Shantung situation, the invasion
of Siberia, and the submarine cables. All that the world
at large got as to the decisions arrived at was the fact
that views were exchanged in a friendly manner, and
some delightfully amusing articles from the pen of Julian
Street who was the scribe of the occasion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Lamont, who seems to be a man for
whom a dinner has little attraction, left the impression
on the Japanese Government that Japan and Japan
alone would lose by holding back. When he left Japan,
to go to China, the Japanese Government was still determined
on securing from the powers exemption for
Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>

<p>But a series of subsequent events helped Japan to
make up her mind. First and foremost among these
was the financial slump in Japan, which was seriously
embarrassing. This was followed by financial stringency
in Manchuria and the eagerness of the directors
of the South Manchurian Railway,&mdash;who are at present
involved in a far-reaching scandal for a loan which could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
not be floated in Japan and which was sought in America.
Third, as either cause or effect, was the situation in
China. China, on account of Japan's courtship of the
Peking militarists and the rape of Shantung, had instituted
a boycott of Japanese goods the bitterness and
force of which Japan had learned to respect. These
circumstances alone might have been enough to drive
a nation to desperation; but a sensitive nation like Japan
would suffer these things a thousand times over in
silence. One thing Japan cannot stand, and that is the
distrust of the world.</p>

<p>And the Lamont party found from the moment it left
Nagasaki for China until the moment it set foot again in
Shimonoseki on its return that there was not a white
man nor a yellow man who had a good word to say for
Japan. Japan was an isolated country socially,&mdash;isolated
a thousand times more definitely than she is geographically.
And the good sense of the Japanese has
brought them to a realization that that does not pay.
Japan wants the good-will of the world, and she wants
it sorely.</p>

<p>When Mr. Lamont arrived in China he did not find the
same atmosphere he had found in Japan. The fact that
he had been in Japan first added to the suspicions of
the Chinese. They had many things to ponder over and
be suspicious about. China remembered the processes of
westernization which she had had to answer with the
Boxer Uprising in 1900. But China has never forgotten
the return of the Boxer indemnity by the United States.</p>

<p>In Peking some students threatened to stone the hotel
at which Mr. Lamont stopped. A few came as special
representatives of the student body, according to one
report, and quizzed Mr. Lamont for two hours. They
left apparently satisfied. Their strong plea was that no
loans be made to the Government until peace between
North and South was established.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>The press of China and the people of China were divided.
Some of the Japanese, who owned papers in
China, sought to alienate the sympathy of the Chinese
for America; some tried other tactics. The Chinese
militarists in Peking who had tasted of the flesh-pots of
Nippon were not over-anxious to put themselves on a
diet. Chinese patriots saw in the new consortium a rope
of a different fiber. The consortium party found itself
double-crossed by obvious agencies.</p>

<p>In a measure this was justified all the way round, for
the undertaking was shrouded in secrecy on many points
which could not but discredit it in the eyes of many.
Perhaps this was unavoidable, but it was none the less
natural that China should be wary. In her own sort
of way, China was taking inventory. The last loan of
$125,000,000 only arrived in China as $104,851,840 after
deductions for underwriting had been paid. And before
the sum can be paid off, it will have cost China $235,768,105
by way of interest and commissions. And China
knows that only a small part of this tremendous sum had
gone into actual constructive work.</p>

<p>Yet China needs assistance. Railroads are the world's
salvation and China's crying need. But for lack of railroads,
China would to-day be the most powerful nation on
earth, financially and politically. And the fact that her
railroads are short while those of other countries are
long makes of her a prey to those tentacles of trade
against which she is helpless. China has to-day only
about 6,500 miles of railroad: she needs 100,000. She
who built the rambling wall has still only foot-paths.
She needs 100,000 miles of highway. Her canals, which
a thousand years ago kept the country open to trade and
partially free from famine, have fallen into disrepair.
She needs telegraphs, telephones, wireless. If only the
money she borrowed went into such enterprises China
would repay the world a thousandfold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>It was therefore natural that China should be suspicious,
and likewise natural that she should be willing
to be convinced. What young China wanted most was
definite and outspoken assurance that her integrity as a
nation would not be jeopardized.</p>

<p>The leading Chinese newspapers expressed their gratitude
at repeated, assurances of due respect being given
to Chinese public opinion and promises to refrain from
interfering in her internal affairs. But others, like the
China "Times," said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The British plan to control our railroads jointly, and the American
plan is to monopolize our industries jointly, while the Japanese plan
to monopolize all our railroads, mines, forestry, and industries. Any
one of these plans will put our destiny in their hands.</p></div>

<p>It also declared: "Although it has been reported that
Japan will make certain compromises, it is hard to say
to what extent these will go."</p>

<p>To this Mr. Lamont said: "It now remains for the
Japanese Government formally to confirm this desire
[of the bankers to join]. If they fail to do so and if
Japan remains outside the consortium, I should think
that Japan might prove to be the chief loser." He next
made it clear to China that she would first have to establish
peace if she is to be helped. Aside from the
reorganization of the currency, the consortium is going
to see to it that a sufficiently safe audit system is established,
so that it will be sure that all loan expenditures
go as far as they should into the properties themselves.
Further, the Chinese Government, in order to save some
cash, refused to pay on certain bearer bonds which had
come back rather curiously. These were formerly German
property bonds on the Hukuan Railway loan which
Germany had evidently sold off before the war. They
had now come back by way of England and America.
The Chinese Government wanted proof of transference
on bearer bonds. Mr. Lamont pointed out to them that
this action would totally discredit them and that the
ability to secure further investments would be very slim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
unless these were redeemed. Mr. Lamont then returned
to Japan.</p>

<p>Then it became known that the Japanese Government
had finally given its consent. In Japan, opinion ranged
from imperialistic chauvinism to liberal recognition of
the consortium as a way out of the mess. On May 11
things came to a head. Mr. Lamont stated on his return
to America that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The fact that Japan has come into the Consortium for China without
reservations should be made clear. The agreement that the Japanese
banking group with the approval of its government, signed at Tokio,
leaves nothing to be desired on this point; but in Japan, while there
was perfect readiness by all authorities to announce that an understanding
had been reached, there seems to be some reluctance to make
public any statement that the Japanese Government had withdrawn
its reservations as to Manchuria and Mongolia. It is only fair, therefore,
that every member of the American banking group and American
investors generally should clearly understand the facts.</p></div>

<p>Still Viscount Uchida, the Foreign Minister, insisted:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While other powers can afford to regard the new Consortium solely
as a business matter Japan is otherwise situated, since her vital national
interests, such as national defense and economic existence, are
apt to be involved in enterprises near her border. When the three
other governments expressly declared to Japan that they not only did
not contemplate acts inimical to her vital interests but were ready to
give assurance sufficiently safeguarding them, the Japanese Government
decided to confirm the Paris agreement.</p></div>

<p>What Japan expected the powers to say other than just
that is a matter for diplomats to play with. To the
common person this statement is absolutely meaningless.
It is a generalization which leaves the door open for
Japan to object to loans for any work which she feels
will jeopardize her national life or vitally affect her "sovereignty."
Any railroad scheme which might become
a competitor by diverting freight from Manchurian lines
owned by Japan would be a menace to Japan's sovereignty.</p>

<p>For instance, it seems understood that among these
vital interests are certain loans to Chinese capitalists
and corporations. And doubtless Japan would right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
now much rather have the millions which she has sunk in
China in her own hands. But if these loans are recognized,
what guarantee is there that even under the nose
of the consortium further "loans" will not be made?</p>

<p>Is it likely that Japan will relinquish her hold on the
South Manchurian Railroad, which in her opinion is of
strategic importance? If the consortium is to have no
say in such vested interests, obtained before its conclusion,
how is it going to secure itself against these very
interests being used as a means of breaking up the unity
of the cooperative enterprises? How is so sweeping a
clause going to be kept within bonds? If Japan is left
in full control of the Manchurian railways, if the consortium
has not really dissolved the Sino-Japanese Military
Agreement, if Japan is to control the German-built
railways in Shantung, how is the consortium going to
better things in the Far East? There is altogether too
much silence on many points in the consortium project
for the world to have any real assurance. Secret diplomacy
having been discredited, it seems that bankers
have themselves broken into diplomacy. Of course, individuals
have a perfect right in this modern world to
discuss whatever matters they like,&mdash;and governments,
too, for that matter,&mdash;but it should seem that the people
as a whole whose money, whose happiness, and whose
lives are involved have a right to know to the last detail
what has been traded off in the making of the consortium.
China evidently was placated by Lamont with full explanations
of what the consortium intended. In brief it
was this:</p>

<p>The agreement calls for the pooling of all such interests
of the several powers in China as had not been
already developed separately, in a "full and free partnership."
In this way it is hoped that future spheres
of influence will be eliminated, jealousies between the
powers be done away with, and Chinese grafters be pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>vented
from pitting one power against the other for their
own selfish ends. Chinese complain that now they will
not be able to secure loans on a competitive basis and that
therefore they are being more surely strangled. That
is partially true. But it is also true that corrupt Chinese
officials have been keeping China and the world in turmoil
for their own greedy ends. Both of these things must
be stopped if peace is to obtain in the Pacific.</p>

<p>The guarantees given to China were to the effect that
in no circumstances would the consortium undertake
such private enterprises as banking, manufacturing, or
commerce, but would devote itself entirely to the construction
of railroads, the laying of highways, and the
reorganization of China's currency. The consortium was
to make loans to the central or provincial government
only, but as a condition of their advancement, peace between
the North and South was urged. The consortium
was not to interfere in the domestic affairs of China.
Loans were to be made only with the approval of the
governments behind the bankers. Nor, of course, can
you compel any one to borrow money from you, wherein
China has the whip hand. Herein lies a very important
possibility.</p>

<p>China has plenty of money. Its bankers hoard enough
to clean up the country's debts in no time. But they
cannot trust their governmental officials; they never
have trusted them. But just lately these bankers have
been awakening to the wisdom of foreign financial
methods, and are adopting them. This may be the first
good result of the consortium.</p>

<p>On the other hand, should the terms of the Anglo-Japanese
Alliance displease China, she may refuse to
recognize the consortium. What then? China has set
out to strangle the alliance, which was formed without
consulting her. But we speculated enough in the last
chapter to show that should the consortium really work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
the Anglo-Japanese Alliance would cease to have any
functional value.</p>

<p>But there are dangers in the consortium,&mdash;and even
in the co&ouml;perative development of China. If Japan
joins whole-heartedly in the consortium, she may be the
greatest gainer. For here are all the powers mutually
developing China, laying railways, and opening up the
resources of the country. Who, more than Japan, is
going to tap China's unlimited raw supplies,&mdash;the coal
in Shansi, for instance, which is enough to supply the
world's needs for a thousand years? And should Japan
in the end still seek the hegemony of the East, she could
utilize these railroads and resources for her own aggrandizement.
Who could stop her? Have not the separate
governments given Japan their assurance that she
"need have no reason to apprehend that the consortium
would direct any activities affecting the security of the
economic life and national defense of Japan?"</p>

<p>There is, it is said, only little left to be told, but that
little may be more than enough. But if China is really
helped to strength and independence, then the greatest
menace that has ever faced mankind will have been
averted, and China, a country with the oldest culture in
the world, will have been won back to civilization. Not
in emasculated alliances but in a healthy cooperation will
the peace of the Pacific be preserved. And the consortium,
as things are in the world, is the first example of
international good sense known to modern history.</p>

<p>Now, the Consortium Agreement is not an idealistic
scheme. The powers recognize that the future peace of
the world depends on how they manage their affairs in
China. If the consortium throws all secrecy to the winds
and comes out openly and at all times for the principles
on which it was formed and for which the several governments
have guaranteed their protection to these banking-groups,
what use is there going to be for the alliance?
Perhaps, to paraphrase President Wilson's statement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
when he went across the Atlantic with his challenge for
the freedom of the seas, Great Britain and Japan may
now have to say to the world: "Gentlemen, the joke's
on us. Why, if the consortium works in China there is
going to be no need of an alliance!"</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>UNCHARTED SEAS</small></h3>


<p>We have taken a long journey together. The main
routes along the Pacific which are the highways
of our past and future intercourse have been inspected.
But the great Pacific basin is not yet everywhere safe
for navigation. There is, I understand, a scientific expedition
now at work thoroughly charting every inch
of that wonderful watery waste. There is, I know, a
scientific body under the directorship of Professor
Gregory of Yale for the thorough research of ethnological
materials among the races of the Pacific. But aside
from the efforts of individuals, politically and socially
and hygienically, there is nothing going on to bind the
peoples together. I had nearly forgotten that a year
ago we did send out a political expedition to the Far
East, a Congressional expedition which spent four days
in Japan and, I daresay, a week in China. Otherwise,
we are still at the mercy of individual scribes, who, like
myself, have their own points of view, their own motives,
and their own reactions.</p>

<p>For years I have read religiously every interview reported
in the press, with spokesmen for one country or
the other on the Pacific. The mass of clippings I have
accumulated I have time and again sifted carefully for
some word or sign that might indicate the real problem.
But I have failed to find any. I cannot lay the responsibility
on the press. It rests with the individuals who
have been asked to give their opinions. But as far as
substance goes, they may all best be illustrated by a sentence
from the speech of Viscount Uchida, the Minister
for Foreign Affairs, delivered before the Imperial Diet.
I have the speech as it came to me from the East and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
West News Bureau. The sentence I have selected, for
the translation of which the Viscount is of course not responsible,
is this: "It is true that this friendly relationship
is not without an occasional mingling of incidents;
that is almost inevitable in any international relations."
All speeches such as these are remarkably free from
definition. Speech after speech is reported, all plead
for understanding, but in none of these is any basis for
understanding given. Sentiment will not dissolve international
suspicion.</p>

<p>Right here I should like to make it clear that Japan is
not the only nation that is being maligned, as some would
have us believe. Exclusion is practised not against
Japan alone, though in other cases it is practised in a different
manner. The Honolulu Chamber of Commerce
excludes white men from entering its sacred sanctums
nearly as much. Unless you are approved by the chamber,
you will find it very difficult to take up a profession.
As I look back over my years of wandering in the farthermost
reaches of the Pacific I recall incident after incident
that is indicative of what is toward.</p>

<p>Wherever competition is rife, the competitors lay
themselves out to be courteous and friendly, but in the
long runs that dissect the waters of that ocean, so secure
have many of the steamship companies felt that
decency has frequently been forgotten. The carelessness
of the rights of the unhappy voyager who merely
pays for a privilege on the Union Steamship Company
is not conducive to international good feeling. The lack
of common courtesy on the part of many of the employees
of this company is proverbial even among the Britons in
Australasia. Peoples in the goings and comings gain
their impressions of countries very often from such
samples as are forced upon their attention en route.
And over the bars in the distant lands compatriots give
vent to recriminations of the compatriots of other nations
in a manner not flattering to either.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most unfortunate features of the whole
problem of the Pacific is that only too often the men who
are accountable for the most serious sources of dislike
are men who at home would be kept in check by a healthy
fear of social ostracism. But once a white man enters
trade in an Oriental port as a clerk or salesman, he
seems to consider it his bounden duty as a representative
of his country to run down the natives as viciously as
he dare. I have seen white men who at home would hold
their tongues lest they offend some decent woman's ears
with their vile language assume an air of superiority
toward the men amongst whom they are living that is
certainly not conducive to international amity. I have
heard them express a longing for a chance some day to
come back and "lick" these natives that, considering the
human sufferings involved, is at the very depths of
unrighteousness.</p>

<p>Nor is this feeling directed against Orientals only. I
have heard serious statements from Americans against
the British that are not only unjustifiable but astounding.
And the British themselves maintain a lordly superiority
to all others. The boast that "the sun never sets on
English soil" is illustrative of a certain provincialism
among Britons that is not healthful from an international
outlook. Britons generally take such routes hither and
thither as leave them always within the British Empire,
and the result is a dull point of view with regard to foreign
lands. To be regarded as a foreigner is a source of
great irritation to a Briton; he cannot stand this "slur"
when passing through America. Even within the British
dominions themselves there are childish prides that make
understanding impossible,&mdash;the New Zealander being
against the Australian and both against everybody else.</p>

<p>These antagonisms more than all else are at the bottom
of the confusion obtaining to-day in the Pacific. Their
utter folly and futility are simply suicidal. Were it not
better that we study carefully the social and political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
ideals of every race on the Pacific and see in what manner
such changes may be effected as will preclude conflict?
Is not America's pre&euml;minence in the Pacific to-day
due to her return of the Boxer indemnity, to her
attempt at winning the sympathy of the Filipino, to her
friendship for China? Cannot the sympathy and the
emulation of races supplant their enmity and jealousy?
In the manner in which the various peoples of the Pacific
turn to their problems lies permanent peace. There is
already a considerable veering round of national conceptions
toward the recognition of our common welfare
being dependent on mutual development, as in the case
of the consortium.</p>

<p>One gets tired of the perennial expressions of felicitation
of the "leaders" of states, of the sentimental balderdash
which emanates from international "functions"
of the world's "best" people, who don one another's
garments and pledge one another eternal affection, of
those who assure us that the fact that one nation has
placed with "us" an order for the latest type of electrically
driven super-dreadnaught indicates the love and
fellowship obtaining between us. Only four years ago,
Viscount Bryce admitted that "Most of us, however,
know so little about the island groups of the Pacific, except
from missionary narratives and from romances,
like those of Robert Louis Stevenson, that the recent action
of the white peoples in the islands is practically a
new subject, and one which well deserves to be dealt
with." And despite all those speeches, despite all the international
societies&mdash;that exist, it seems, only to entertain
celebrities, not to uncover misunderstandings
that they may truly be corrected&mdash;real irritation comes
from the average man's notions, and to him should attention
be directed.</p>

<p>Those vast spaces to which Viscount Bryce referred,
once regarded with such awe, are now criss-crossed with
a veritable network of steamers. They have made short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
shrift of the distances between the East and the West.
We may invite one another across for week-ends, but
not necessarily for life, and the impressions each brings
away with him will go toward making up the sum total
of what is going to be the thought of the Pacific. Are
we to navalize the Pacific or to civilize it? Are we to
convert every projecting rock into a menace, or are we
to be honest navigators exposing every treacherous
island for the safety of all races? Are we to scramble
for interests in the Pacific, or are we to help races there
to rise to strength and independence, so that each will be
a healthy buffer against aggression? The "Valor of
Ignorance" is not to be met with the blindness of force.</p>

<p>I sought to obtain a bit of information once from a dispenser
of "understanding" located in New York, but
he tried to lead me off the scent. It was not, he feared,
to his country's credit that such and such facts be known.
He was very sensitive, and gave me no assistance. This
covering up of our weaknesses before the eyes of our
neighbors is certain to lead to disaster. This putting
our best foot forward, only to have the other ready for
a nasty kick, is not going to bring about amity. If
there is an ideal worthy of emulation in any race in the
Pacific, we ought to know and honor it. If there is a
sore which needs scientific political treatment, let us
attend to it. Our problems are well defined, if we will
but look for them; our obligations are clear, if we will
but undertake them courageously.</p>

<p>We are not going to solve our problems as we did with
the coming of Japan into the range of the world,&mdash;by
adulation. To-day we are suffering from the effects
of having made the Japanese feel that they are perfect
and to be adored. The problem is one of unadulterated
education, of education in the simple arts of self-support
among the primitive people, and self-government among
the more advanced.</p>

<p>But if our efforts are to be fruitful we must avoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
abstract education which leads to hair-splitting. It is
to be education in the fundamentals,&mdash;education in the
use of hands and brain for self-support and mutual happiness
founded on justice. It is to be education of ourselves
as well as of those we wish to elevate.</p>

<p>But the problem is even deeper than that. Merely
elevating other races will not preclude conflict. Germany
was well educated and on a level with, if not in
many ways superior to the nations roundabout her.
Her very development created friction. And the talk of
Japan as a menace is largely due to the fact that Japan
has grown out of the lowly state in which her exclusionists
had placed her for two hundred and fifty years.
As yet China is no "menace," for China has still her
teeming hordes who curtail one another's usefulness.</p>

<p>Nor, as I have said in the chapter on Australasia, will
the problem of our relationship with the people of the
Pacific be solved by the effort of labor to keep up its own
high standards by the exclusion of those of lower standard.</p>

<p>Nor will the problem be solved by our assuming
more and more protectorates over simple nations unused
to the tricks of diplomacy.</p>

<p>Our problem will be solved only by working assiduously
for international co&ouml;peration. Our problem will
clear away when all nations establish departments open
to civil-service appointments of people who will enter
the field of education and uplift work without other
compensation possible than that of an honest salary.
There should be a Department of Education for the Pacific
in which the people of the United States do out of
their own funds what we did in China out of the moneys
paid in the Boxer indemnity. This department would
study the races of the Pacific with a view to finding what
are the special requirements of each particular people
and how they can be supplied. There should be a Bureau
of Social Hygiene and Sanitary Engineering recruited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
from the American student body with luring pay, drawing
thousands of young physicians and engineers out into
the various Pacific islands to study the questions of the
eradication of disease and the care of body and mind.
There should be a Bureau of Civics and International
Law carrying to the peoples of the Pacific whose simplicity
lays them open to the chicanery of political parasites
the simple truths of human relationships as we
understand them. So the entire fabric of civilization
might be spread over the waters of the Pacific. But to
guard against the possibility of some sword piercing it
and rending it must come the voice of civilization calling
shame upon the present practices of any nation now
operating in the Pacific in other than pacific ways.</p>

<p>All this must be done not by America alone, but by all
the people now in a position to co&ouml;perate. Just as
Japan codified her laws and changed them in conformity
with those of the West, so as to regain full rights over
foreigners in her own territory, so must all the nations
reorganize their laws in conformity with the best interests
of all. There must be judges in all lands who know
the laws of other lands as well as their own and an attempt
be made to bring them all in greater conformity
to a universal standard of justice, of right and wrong.
There must be educators set to work studying the educational
systems of nations on the Pacific so as to bring
the methods more and more in line with one another.
There must be departments of health advising one another
how so to remedy conditions as to eliminate the
danger of spread of plague. It is not enough that we
have an excellent department of health vigilant in the
exclusion of plague; our department of health should co-operate
with that of Japan and of Australasia, and of
every island in the Pacific. In other words, we must
realize that the problems of every group anywhere in
the world affect for good or ill our own welfare.</p>

<p>Our problem in the Pacific is therefore ten times more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
complicated than that which faced the powers in Morocco,
Africa and Persia. While the diversity of nations was
great in Europe, in the Pacific it is greater. But while
the relationship in the Balkans was in some cases close,
not only in sheer propinquity, but in development, in
the Pacific not only is the blood running in the veins of
the races in many cases extremely alien, one to the other,
but the distances separating them in space and in development
make co&ouml;peration and getting together difficult.
This makes it easier for selfish nations to place themselves
as wedges between them. The scramble after
mandates in the Pacific indicates the recognition of their
importance.</p>

<p>But in inverse ratio,&mdash;in so far as the races of the
Pacific have none of the irritating intimacy which obtained
in Europe, the problem is clearer. The repetition
of the intrigues which Germany, through her daughter
on the Russian throne, could carry out, is here impossible.
Only once in my knowledge has royal intermarriage
been attempted and it proved a failure. The
Japanese changed their law against the marriage of their
royalty with royalty of another race in favor of Korea&mdash;and
to forestall a Japanese-Korean union we are told,
the Ex-Emperor of Korea committed suicide. Insurrection
followed. The marriage has since taken place, but
Korea is no longer an independent empire.</p>

<p>The more pronounced differences of race should perhaps
be recognized, but recognized with sympathy.
Each race then presents its own problems. But over all
must come recognition of the commonalty of man. This
does not mean international fawning and flattering of
one another. Racial equality must be admitted, but not
as Japan sponsored it,&mdash;with the existence of her own
castes and classes, and the oppression of Korea,&mdash;but in
full recognition of the latent possibilities in all peoples.
Japan regards herself as infinitely superior to all man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>kind.
So do we. But that must be replaced by realization
of the historical worthiness of Orientals as well as
Caucasians.</p>

<p>We have in the Pacific, as has been seen, a great number
of races in varying degrees of development. Most of
them know little of one another and hate one another
less. They have never been close enough for serious
conflict, and they need never be. We can instil into
them through educational channels a regard for one another
which all the love-potions in the world could not
pour into the races of Europe, inured to war and slaughter
and religious bigotry.</p>

<p>There is still one great obstacle in the way of a peaceful
solution of the problems of the Pacific, an obstacle
that can be overcome only by a rapid evolution or revolution.
Even as the forces for the greater liberation of
the people are at work in China, now bound no more
by her own swaddling-clothes of imperialism, so must
they be encouraged in Japan, whose bureaucracy is
to-day entangling not only her own liberal elements, but
a greater number of nations in the Pacific. Jingoists
speak of the yellow peril as though it were a single thing,
elemental and simply conquerable. But it is not very
different from the peril of imperialism everywhere.</p>

<p>In the working out of the problems of the Pacific,
Japan is the farthest from our ken. Our relations with
Australia and New Zealand and with Canada&mdash;apart
from Great Britain&mdash;are already more or less intimate.
Just as Japan is beginning to realize that she must make
China her friend, so must we four Western nations on
the Pacific realize the fullness of the possibilities in co&ouml;peration.
There should be an exchange of opinion, a
greater supply of news from one to the other,&mdash;news of
personal, educational and geographical value, in the nature
of local news. With these four countries as a nucleus
and the same thing going on between China and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
Japan, the problem of the East understanding the West
will be simplified.</p>

<p>But we must show that we appreciate the fine points
in the Oriental civilizations, while the Orient will have to
remove from its conscience the hatred of the foreigner.
The millennium? Not in the least. Just the beginning
of our groping toward human commonalty.</p>

<p class="noidt">Mr. Sydney Greenbie,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New York, U.S.A.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Your letter of 26th March has been forwarded to me from Samoa. I relinquished
the Administration when Civil Government was established there.</p>

<p>The Chief whose funeral you saw was TAMASESE, a son of the late King
Tamasese.... MATAAFA, the son of King Mataafa, died in the influenza epidemic
in 1918 and I dug his grave with my own hands, everyone working hard
to avoid a pestilence.</p>

<p>The Chief TAMASESE was made much of by the Germans when they were
in Samoa, was taken a trip to Berlin but was not allowed to visit England. He
remained pro-German to the end; one of the few Samoans who did so.</p>

<p>On his death-bed Tamasese remembered a promise made to his deceased
father (he said the spirit of his father appeared to him and reproached him)
that he would bring the late King's bones to the family burying place and he
could not die in peace until this was done. I was approached in the matter
and at once sent a Government launch with the family party to get the bones,
and they were put in a coffin and buried in the family ground. This done,
Tamasese passed away in peace in a very short time.</p>

<p>You are probably aware that when Tamasese's body was lying in state the
hair was sprinkled with gold dust and a German crown made of white flowers
was placed on the coffin. The widow had a Samoan house built alongside the
tomb on the Mulinuu peninsula and lived in it for some months in spite of the
stench which came from the tomb. She died in the influenza epidemic in 1918,
having in the meantime named one of the native Samoan judges.</p>

<p>I am sorry the information I can give you is so meagre, but I have not my
records here as yet.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Greenbie</span>:</p>

<p>Your letter of Feb. 20th was forwarded on to me here, and reached me
yesterday.</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot tell you definitely as to the celebration held in
Samoa in 1915, in honor of the late "King"; I returned to Samoa in 1917 after
an absence of some years, and heard nothing of it. I think, however, that the
celebration must have been for Mataafa, as the natives told you that the deceased
Chief had been the favorite of Mataafa.</p>

<p>Stevenson rather despised Laupepa who although an amiable man and the
rightful King, was of feeble character, and when broken up by the suffering and
indignity of his deportation by the Germans, weakly ceded the throne to Mataafa
out of gratitude for the stand taken by the latter on his behalf during the years
of his exile.</p>

<p>My own conviction is that, had R. L. S. lived a few years longer, he would
have realized that his championship of Mataafa was a mistake, and precipitated
the very event he wished to avoid&mdash;the German rule in Samoa.</p>

<p class="center">Very sincerely yours,</p>

October 5th, 1904.</p>

<p class="noidt">A. M. Sutherland, Esq.,<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; San Francisco, U.S.A.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>The kind invitation extended to me by the members of the "Stevenson
Fellowship" through your welcome letter or the 17th August, 1904, has been
received by me with great delight. I thank you and the Committee from the
bottom of my heart for remembering me, and for including my name in the long
list of friends whom Tusitala has left behind to mourn his irreparable loss. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
would have very much liked to be present and meet you all on this fitting occasion,
but the fact is, my health and old age will not permit me to cross the vast
waters over to America. So I send you many greetings wishing the "Stevenson
Fellowship" every success on the 13th November next. And whilst you are
celebrating this memorable day in America, we shall even celebrate it in Samoa.
It is true that I, like yourselves, revere the memory of Tusitala. Though the
strong hand of Death has removed him from our midst, yet the remembrance of
his many humane acts, let alone his literary career, will never be forgotten.
That household name, Tusitala, is as euphonious to our Samoan ears as much
as the name Stevenson is pleasing to all other European friends and admirers.
Tusitala was born a hero, and he died a hero among men. He was a man of
his word, but a man of deeds not words. When first I saw Tusitala he addressed
me and said: "Samoa is a beautiful country. I like its people and
clime, and shall write in my books accordingly. The Samoan Chiefs may be
compared to our Scotch Chiefs at home in regard to their clans." "Then stay
here with me," I said, "and make Samoa your home altogether." "That I will,
and even if the Lord calls me," was the reply. Tusitala&mdash;story-writer&mdash;spoke
the truth, for even now he is still with me in Samoa. Truth is great and must
endure. Tusitala's religion and motto was: "Do ye to others as ye would have
them do unto you." Hence this noble, illustrious man has won my love and
admiration, as well as the esteem and respect of all who knew him. My God
is the same God who called away Tusitala, and when it has pleased Him for
my appointed time to come, then I will gladly join T. in that eternal home
where we meet to part no more.</p>

<p>With perfect assurance of my best wishes for your progress and prosperity,&mdash;I
remain, dear sir, cordially yours,</p>

<p class="ralign">April 24, 1921 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam:</span></p>

<p>Thank you very much for the letter which came some four months ago. I
read it over, over and over again to memorise every word of the letter, and it
was a glad toil. I thought of you and Mr. ... I thought of Messrs.
F.... D.... and R.... and Miss G...., every body to-gether and every
body separate that gave me untold happiness, and I heard the throbs of my heart.
I told to my wife who is very glad to hear from me. As you know I got married
in the year of 1913. And we have five children now. Please don't be scared!
Two boys and three daughters. Takako oldest daughter six year, seven months
old. Takashige, William (boy) four years; Fuziko Elsie two years and nearly
four months; Chiyeko, Lucie eight months old. And this made me perfect papa,
which is my joy and my pride! Beside this I have thirty acres of orange
orchard (four years old) all is my own, and my wife's now which brought me
four (boxes-horses) (?) poor fruit year before last, and seventy two boxes better
fruit last year. I am expecting greater crop this fall. I read Mr. &mdash;&mdash; article
about June drop in California Cultivator, and irrigated my orchards last December
and this year I started to wet from February which no body does this in
this visinity (orchardists of here keep orchards with weeds and wild oats as
high as my shoulder all winter and they wait irrigation until orchards perfectly
dry and cracke.) I am taking care our orchards after Mr. &mdash;&mdash; idea mostly
with some of my own, as I feel as it mine but all of them are a collection of
idea of other people's experiences.</p>

<p>I have debt of five thousand five hundreds dollars which need not to pay
interest except one thousand five hundred dollars. This is my joy and my pride
too, is it not?</p>

<p>Five children and five thousand five hundreds dollars debt are not big job
to carry on, for me, but they make me very busy indeed. For this reason, I do
not write to my friends, as often as I wish, of course I can, if I do, like this
one, but it is great strain for me now.</p>

<p>Therefore please will kindly excuse, I shall not write you again until next
Christmas probably.</p>

<p>Please remember me to Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and All your family.</p>

<p>When you will come to Terra Bella to see Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>When you have spare time, and when you thought of old servant, please
stop a moment at my humble dwelling place and give me chance to hear your
voice directly. That will be my honor, that which will encourage me, if it is
possible with Mr. F. P. It will be a greater honor for us. Befor I ask you to
come to see us, we should go to see you first, but just excuse for the reasons as
above written.</p>

<p>I shall leave the pen with prare of your sound health, and happiness. God
be with you.</p>
